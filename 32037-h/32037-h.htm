<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> the few who love me and whom I love—to those
who feel rather than to those who think—to the dreamers
and those who put faith in dreams as in the only realities—I
offer this Book of Truths, not in its character of Truth-Teller,
but for the Beauty that abounds in its Truth; constituting
it true. To these I present the composition as an
Art-Product alone:—let us say as a Romance; or, if I be
not urging too lofty a claim, as a Poem.</p>

<p><i>What I here propound is true</i>:—therefore it cannot
die:—or if by any means it be now trodden down so that it
die, it will “rise again to the Life Everlasting.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless it is as a Poem only that I wish this work
to be judged after I am dead.</p>

<h3>AN ESSAY ON THE MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL UNIVERSE.</h3>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is with humility really unassumed—it is with a sentiment
even of awe—that I pen the opening sentence of this
work: for of all conceivable subjects I approach the reader
with the most solemn—the most comprehensive—the most
difficult—the most august.</p>

<p>What terms shall I find sufficiently simple in their sublimity—sufficiently
sublime in their simplicity—for the mere
enunciation of my theme?</p>

<p>I design to speak of the <i>Physical, Metaphysical and
Mathematical—of the Material and Spiritual Universe:—of
its Essence, its Origin, its Creation, its Present Condition
and its Destiny</i>. I shall be so rash, moreover, as to
challenge the conclusions, and thus, in effect, to question
the sagacity, of many of the greatest and most justly reverenced
of men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>In the beginning, let me as distinctly as possible announce—not
the theorem which I hope to demonstrate—for, whatever
the mathematicians may assert, there is, in this world
at least, <i>no such thing</i> as demonstration—but the ruling
idea which, throughout this volume, I shall be continually
endeavoring to suggest.</p>

<p>My general proposition, then, is this:—<i>In the Original
Unity of the First Thing lies the Secondary Cause of All
Things, with the Germ of their Inevitable Annihilation</i>.</p>

<p>In illustration of this idea, I propose to take such a survey
of the Universe that the mind may be able really to
receive and to perceive an individual impression.</p>

<p>He who from the top of Ætna casts his eyes leisurely
around, is affected chiefly by the <i>extent</i> and <i>diversity</i> of the
scene. Only by a rapid whirling on his heel could he hope
to comprehend the panorama in the sublimity of its <i>oneness</i>.
But as, on the summit of Ætna, <i>no</i> man has thought of
whirling on his heel, so no man has ever taken into his
brain the full uniqueness of the prospect; and so, again,
whatever considerations lie involved in this uniqueness,
have as yet no practical existence for mankind.</p>

<p>I do not know a treatise in which a survey of the <i>Universe</i>—using
the word in its most comprehensive and only
legitimate acceptation—is taken at all:—and it may be as
well here to mention that by the term “Universe,” wherever
employed without qualification in this essay, I mean to designate
<i>the utmost conceivable expanse of space, with all
things, spiritual and material, that can be imagined to exist
within the compass of that expanse</i>. In speaking of what is
ordinarily implied by the expression, “Universe,” I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
take a phrase of limitation—“the Universe of stars.” Why
this distinction is considered necessary, will be seen in the
sequel.</p>

<p>But even of treatises on the really limited, although
always assumed as the <i>un</i>limited, Universe of <i>stars</i>, I know
none in which a survey, even of this limited Universe, is
so taken as to warrant deductions from its <i>individuality</i>.
The nearest approach to such a work is made in the “Cosmos”
of Alexander Von Humboldt. He presents the subject,
however, <i>not</i> in its individuality but in its generality.
His theme, in its last result, is the law of <i>each</i> portion of the
merely physical Universe, as this law is related to the laws
of <i>every other</i> portion of this merely physical Universe. His
design is simply synœretical. In a word, he discusses the
universality of material relation, and discloses to the eye of
Philosophy whatever inferences have hitherto lain hidden
<i>behind</i> this universality. But however admirable be the
succinctness with which he has treated each particular
point of his topic, the mere multiplicity of these points occasions,
necessarily, an amount of detail, and thus an involution
of idea, which precludes all <i>individuality</i> of impression.</p>

<p>It seems to me that, in aiming at this latter effect, and,
through it, at the consequences—the conclusions—the suggestions—the
speculations—or, if nothing better offer itself
the mere guesses which may result from it—we require
something like a mental gyration on the heel. We need so
rapid a revolution of all things about the central point of
sight that, while the minutiæ vanish altogether, even the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
more conspicuous objects become blended into one. Among
the vanishing minutiæ, in a survey of this kind, would be all
exclusively terrestrial matters. The Earth would be considered
in its planetary relations alone. A man, in this
view, becomes mankind; mankind a member of the cosmical
family of Intelligences.</p>

<p>And now, before proceeding to our subject proper, let
me beg the reader’s attention to an extract or two from a
somewhat remarkable letter, which appears to have been
found corked in a bottle and floating on the <i>Mare Tenebrarum</i>—an
ocean well described by the Nubian geographer,
Ptolemy Hephestion, but little frequented in modern days
unless by the Transcendentalists and some other divers for
crotchets. The date of this letter, I confess, surprises me
even more particularly than its contents; for it seems to
have been written in the year <i>two</i> thousand eight hundred
and forty-eight. As for the passages I am about to transcribe,
they, I fancy, will speak for themselves.</p>

<p>“Do you know, my dear friend,” says the writer, addressing,
no doubt, a contemporary—“Do you know that it
is scarcely more than eight or nine hundred years ago since
the metaphysicians first consented to relieve the people of
the singular fancy that there exist <i>but two practicable roads
to Truth</i>? Believe it if you can! It appears, however, that
long, long ago, in the night of Time, there lived a Turkish
philosopher called Aries and surnamed Tottle.” [Here, possibly,
the letter-writer means Aristotle; the best names are
wretchedly corrupted in two or three thousand years.] “The
fame of this great man depended mainly upon his demonstration
that sneezing is a natural provision, by means of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
which over-profound thinkers are enabled to expel superfluous
ideas through the nose; but he obtained a scarcely less
valuable celebrity as the founder, or at all events as the
principal propagator, of what was termed the <i>de</i>ductive or
<i>à priori</i> philosophy. He started with what he maintained
to be axioms, or self-evident truths:—and the now well understood
fact that <i>no</i> truths are <i>self</i>-evident, really does not
make in the slightest degree against his speculations:—it
was sufficient for his purpose that the truths in question
were evident at all. From axioms he proceeded, logically,
to results. His most illustrious disciples were one Tuclid, a
geometrician,” [meaning Euclid] “and one Kant, a Dutchman,
the originator of that species of Transcendentalism
which, with the change merely of a C for a K, now bears
his peculiar name.</p>

<p>“Well, Aries Tottle flourished supreme, until the advent
of one Hog, surnamed ‘the Ettrick shepherd,’ who preached
an entirely different system, which he called the <i>à posteriori</i>
or <i>in</i>ductive. His plan referred altogether to sensation.
He proceeded by observing, analyzing, and classifying facts—<i>instantiæ
Naturæ</i>, as they were somewhat affectedly
called—and arranging them into general laws. In a word,
while the mode of Aries rested on <i>noumena</i>, that of Hog
depended on <i>phenomena</i>; and so great was the admiration
excited by this latter system that, at its first introduction,
Aries fell into general disrepute. Finally, however, he
recovered ground, and was permitted to divide the empire
of Philosophy with his more modern rival:—the savans
contenting themselves with proscribing all <i>other</i> competitors,
past, present, and to come; putting an end to all controversy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
on the topic by the promulgation of a Median law,
to the effect that the Aristotelian and Baconian roads are,
and of right ought to be, the solo possible avenues to knowledge:—‘Baconian,’
you must know, my dear friend,” adds
the letter-writer at this point, “was an adjective invented
as equivalent to Hog-ian, and at the same time more dignified
and euphonious.</p>

<p>“Now I do assure you most positively”—proceeds the
epistle—“that I represent these matters fairly; and you can
easily understand how restrictions so absurd on their very
face must have operated, in those days, to retard the progress
of true Science, which makes its most important
advances—as all History will show—by seemingly intuitive
<i>leaps</i>. These ancient ideas confined investigation to crawling;
and I need not suggest to you that crawling, among
varieties of locomotion, is a very capital thing of its kind;—but
because the tortoise is sure of foot, for this reason must
we clip the wings of the eagles? For many centuries, so
great was the infatuation, about Hog especially, that a virtual
stop was put to all thinking, properly so called. No
man dared utter a truth for which he felt himself indebted
to his soul alone. It mattered not whether the truth was
even demonstrably such; for the dogmatizing philosophers
of that epoch regarded only <i>the road</i> by which it professed
to have been attained. The end, with them, was a point of
no moment, whatever:—‘the means!’ they vociferated—‘let
us look at the means!’—and if, on scrutiny of the means,
it was found to come neither under the category Hog, nor
under the category Aries (which means ram), why then the
savans went no farther, but, calling the thinker a fool and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
branding him a ‘theorist,’ would never, thenceforward, have
any thing to do either with <i>him</i> or with his truths.</p>

<p>“Now, my dear friend,” continues the letter-writer, “it
cannot be maintained that by the crawling system, exclusively
adopted, men would arrive at the maximum amount
of truth, even in any long series of ages; for the repression
of imagination was an evil not to be counterbalanced even
by <i>absolute</i> certainty in the snail processes. But their certainty
was very far from absolute. The error of our progenitors
was quite analogous with that of the wiseacre who
fancies he must necessarily see an object the more distinctly,
the more closely he holds it to his eyes. They blinded
themselves, too, with the impalpable, titillating Scotch snuff
of <i>detail</i>; and thus the boasted facts of the Hog-ites were
by no means always facts—a point of little importance but
for the assumption that they always <i>were</i>. The vital taint,
however, in Baconianism—its most lamentable fount of
error—lay in its tendency to throw power and consideration
into the hands of merely perceptive men—of those
inter-Tritonic minnows, the microscopical savans—the diggers
and pedlers of minute <i>facts</i>, for the most part in physical
science—facts all of which they retailed at the same price
upon the highway; their value depending, it was supposed,
simply upon the <i>fact of their fact</i>, without reference to
their applicability or inapplicability in the development of
those ultimate and only legitimate facts, called Law.</p>

<p>“Than the persons”—the letter goes on to say—“Than
the persons thus suddenly elevated by the Hog-ian philosophy
into a station for which they were unfitted—thus transferred
from the sculleries into the parlors of Science—from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
its pantries into its pulpits—than these individuals a
more intolerant—a more intolerable set of bigots and
tyrants never existed on the face of the earth. Their creed,
their text and their sermon were, alike, the one word ‘<i>fact</i>’—but,
for the most part, even of this one word, they knew
not even the meaning. On those who ventured to <i>disturb</i>
their facts with the view of putting them in order and to
use, the disciples of Hog had no mercy whatever. All attempts
at generalization were met at once by the words
‘theoretical,’ ‘theory,’ ‘theorist’—all <i>thought</i>, to be brief,
was very properly resented as a personal affront to themselves.
Cultivating the natural sciences to the exclusion of
Metaphysics, the Mathematics, and Logic, many of these
Bacon-engendered philosophers—one-idead, one-sided and
lame of a leg—were more wretchedly helpless—more miserably
ignorant, in view of all the comprehensible objects
of knowledge, than the veriest unlettered hind who proves
that he knows something at least, in admitting that he
knows absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>“Nor had our forefathers any better right to talk about
<i>certainty</i>, when pursuing, in blind confidence, the <i>à priori</i>
path of axioms, or of the Ram. At innumerable points this
path was scarcely as straight as a ram’s-horn. The simple
truth is, that the Aristotelians erected their castles upon a
basis far less reliable than air; <i>for no such things as axioms
ever existed or can possibly exist at all</i>. This they must
have been very blind, indeed, not to see, or at least to suspect;
for, even in their own day, many of their long-admitted
‘axioms’ had been abandoned:—‘<i>ex nihilo nihil fit</i>,’
for example, and a ‘thing cannot act where it is not,’ and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
‘there cannot be antipodes,’ and ‘darkness cannot proceed
from light.’ These and numerous similar propositions formerly
accepted, without hesitation, as axioms, or undeniable
truths, were, even at the period of which I speak, seen to
be altogether untenable:—how absurd in these people, then,
to persist in relying upon a basis, as immutable, whose mutability
had become so repeatedly manifest!</p>

<p>“But, even through evidence afforded by themselves
against themselves, it is easy to convict these <i>à priori</i>
reasoners of the grossest unreason—it is easy to show the
futility—the impalpability of their axioms in general. I
have now lying before me”—it will be observed that we
still proceed with the letter—“I have now lying before me
a book printed about a thousand years ago. Pundit assures
me that it is decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its
topic, which is ‘Logic.’ The author, who was much
esteemed in his day, was one Miller, or Mill; and we find
it recorded of him, as a point of some importance, that he
rode a mill-horse whom he called Jeremy Bentham:—but
let us glance at the volume itself!</p>

<p>“Ah!—‘Ability or inability to conceive,’ says Mr. Mill
very properly, ‘is <i>in no case</i> to be received as a criterion of
axiomatic truth.’ Now, that this is a palpable truism no
one in his senses will deny. <i>Not</i> to admit the proposition,
is to insinuate a charge of variability in Truth itself, whose
very title is a synonym of the Steadfast. If ability to conceive
be taken as a criterion of Truth, then a truth to
<i>David</i> Hume would very seldom be a truth to <i>Joe</i>; and
ninety-nine hundredths of what is undeniable in Heaven
would be demonstrable falsity upon Earth. The proposition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of Mr. Mill, then, is sustained. I will not grant it to be an
<i>axiom</i>; and this merely because I am showing that <i>no</i>
axioms exist; but, with a distinction which could not have
been cavilled at even by Mr. Mill himself, I am ready to
grant that, <i>if</i> an axiom <i>there be</i>, then the proposition of which
we speak has the fullest right to be considered an axiom—that
no <i>more</i> absolute axiom <i>is</i>—and, consequently, that any
subsequent proposition which shall conflict with this one
primarily advanced, must be either a falsity in itself—that
is to say no axiom—or, if admitted axiomatic, must at once
neutralize both itself and its predecessor.</p>

<p>“And now, by the logic of their own propounder, let us
proceed to test any one of the axioms propounded. Let us
give Mr. Mill the fairest of play. We will bring the point
to no ordinary issue. We will select for investigation no
common-place axiom—no axiom of what, not the less preposterously
because only impliedly, he terms his secondary
class—as if a positive truth by definition could be either
more or less positively a truth:—we will select, I say, no
axiom of an unquestionability so questionable as is to be
found in Euclid. We will not talk, for example, about such
propositions as that two straight lines cannot enclose a
space, or that the whole is greater than any one of its parts.
We will afford the logician <i>every</i> advantage. We will come
at once to a proposition which he regards as the acme of the
unquestionable—as the quintessence of axiomatic undeniability.
Here it is:—‘Contradictions cannot <i>both</i> be true—that
is, cannot cöexist in nature.’ Here Mr. Mill means,
for instance,—and I give the most forcible instance conceivable—that
a tree must be either a tree or <i>not</i> a tree—that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
it cannot be at the same time a tree <i>and</i> not a tree:—all
which is quite reasonable of itself and will answer remarkably
well as an axiom, until we bring it into collation with
an axiom insisted upon a few pages before—in other words—words
which I have previously employed—until we test
it by the logic of its own propounder. ‘A tree,’ Mr. Mill
asserts, ‘must be either a tree or <i>not</i> a tree.’ Very well:—and
now let me ask him, <i>why</i>. To this little query there
is but one response:—I defy any man living to invent a
second. The sole answer is this:—‘Because we find it
<i>impossible to conceive</i> that a tree can be any thing else than
a tree or not a tree.’ This, I repeat, is Mr. Mill’s sole
answer:—he will not <i>pretend</i> to suggest another:—and
yet, by his own showing, his answer is clearly no answer
at all; for has he not already required us to admit, <i>as an
axiom</i>, that ability or inability to conceive is <i>in no case</i> to
be taken as a criterion of axiomatic truth? Thus all—absolutely
<i>all</i> his argumentation is at sea without a rudder.
Let it not be urged that an exception from the general rule
is to be made, in cases where the ‘impossibility to conceive’
is so peculiarly great as when we are called upon to
conceive a tree <i>both</i> a tree and <i>not</i> a tree. Let no attempt,
I say, be made at urging this sotticism; for, in the first
place, there are no <i>degrees</i> of ‘impossibility,’ and thus no
one impossible conception can be <i>more</i> peculiarly impossible
than another impossible conception:—in the second place,
Mr. Mill himself, no doubt after thorough deliberation, has
most distinctly, and most rationally, excluded all opportunity
for exception, by the emphasis of his proposition, that,
<i>in no case</i>, is ability or inability to conceive, to be taken as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
a criterion of axiomatic truth:—in the third place, even
were exceptions admissible at all, it remains to be shown
how any exception is admissible <i>here</i>. That a tree can be
both a tree and not a tree, is an idea which the angels, or
the devils, <i>may</i> entertain, and which no doubt many an
earthly Bedlamite, or Transcendentalist, <i>does</i>.</p>

<p>“Now I do not quarrel with these ancients,” continues
the letter-writer, “<i>so much</i> on account of the transparent
frivolity of their logic—which, to be plain, was baseless,
worthless and fantastic altogether—as on account of their
pompous and infatuate proscription of all <i>other</i> roads to
Truth than the two narrow and crooked paths—the one
of creeping and the other of crawling—to which, in their
ignorant perversity, they have dared to confine the Soul—the
Soul which loves nothing so well as to soar in those
regions of illimitable intuition which are utterly incognizant
of ‘<i>path</i>.’</p>

<p>“By the bye, my dear friend, is it not an evidence of
the mental slavery entailed upon those bigoted people by
their Hogs and Rams, that in spite of the eternal prating
of their savans about <i>roads</i> to Truth, none of them fell,
even by accident, into what we now so distinctly perceive
to be the broadest, the straightest and most available of all
mere roads—the great thoroughfare—the majestic highway
of the <i>Consistent</i>? Is it not wonderful that they should
have failed to deduce from the works of God the vitally
momentous consideration that <i>a perfect consistency can be
nothing but an absolute truth</i>? How plain—how rapid
our progress since the late announcement of this proposition!
By its means, investigation has been taken out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the hands of the ground-moles, and given as a duty, rather
than as a task, to the true—to the <i>only</i> true thinkers—to
the generally-educated men of ardent imagination. These
latter—our Keplers—our Laplaces—‘speculate’—‘theorize’—these
are the terms—can you not fancy the shout of scorn
with which they would be received by our progenitors,
were it possible for them to be looking over my shoulders
as I write? The Keplers, I repeat, speculate—theorize—and
their theories are merely corrected—reduced—sifted—cleared,
little by little, of their chaff of inconsistency—until
at length there stands apparent an unencumbered <i>Consistency</i>—a
consistency which the most stolid admit—because
it <i>is</i> a consistency—to be an absolute and an unquestionable
<i>Truth</i>.</p>

<p>“I have often thought, my friend, that it must have puzzled
these dogmaticians of a thousand years ago, to determine,
even, by which of their two boasted roads it is that
the cryptographist attains the solution of the more complicate
cyphers—or by which of them Champollion guided
mankind to those important and innumerable truths which,
for so many centuries, have lain entombed amid the phonetical
hieroglyphics of Egypt. In especial, would it not have
given these bigots some trouble to determine by which of
their two roads was reached the most momentous and sublime
of <i>all</i> their truths—the truth—the fact of <i>gravitation</i>?
Newton deduced it from the laws of Kepler. Kepler admitted
that these laws he <i>guessed</i>—these laws whose investigation
disclosed to the greatest of British astronomers that
principle, the basis of all (existing) physical principle, in
going behind which we enter at once the nebulous kingdom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of Metaphysics. Yes!—these vital laws Kepler <i>guessed</i>—that
is to say, he <i>imagined</i> them. Had he been asked to
point out either the <i>de</i>ductive or <i>in</i>ductive route by which
he attained them, his reply might have been—‘I know
nothing about <i>routes</i>—but I <i>do</i> know the machinery of the
Universe. Here it is. I grasped it with <i>my soul</i>—I reached
it through mere dint of <i>intuition</i>.’ Alas, poor ignorant old
man! Could not any metaphysician have told him that what
he called ‘intuition’ was but the conviction resulting from
<i>de</i>ductions or <i>in</i>ductions of which the processes were so
shadowy as to have escaped his consciousness, eluded his
reason, or bidden defiance to his capacity of expression?
How great a pity it is that some ‘moral philosopher’ had
not enlightened him about all this! How it would have
comforted him on his death-bed to know that, instead of
having gone intuitively and thus unbecomingly, he had, in
fact, proceeded decorously and legitimately—that is to say
Hog-ishly, or at least Ram-ishly—into the vast halls where
lay gleaming, untended, and hitherto untouched by mortal
hand—unseen by mortal eye—the imperishable and priceless
secrets of the Universe!</p>

<p>“Yes, Kepler was essentially a <i>theorist</i>; but this title,
<i>now</i> of so much sanctity, was, in those ancient days, a designation
of supreme contempt. It is only <i>now</i> that men
begin to appreciate that divine old man—to sympathize
with the prophetical and poetical rhapsody of his ever-memorable
words. For <i>my</i> part,” continues the unknown
correspondent, “I glow with a sacred fire when I even
think of them, and feel that I shall never grow weary of
their repetition:—in concluding this letter, let me have the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
real pleasure of transcribing them once again:—‘<i>I care not
whether my work be read now or by posterity. I can afford
to wait a century for readers when God himself has waited
six thousand years for an observer. I triumph. I have
stolen the golden secret of the Egyptians. I will indulge
my sacred fury.</i>’”</p>

<p>Here end my quotations from this very unaccountable
and, perhaps, somewhat impertinent epistle; and perhaps
it would be folly to comment, in any respect, upon the
chimerical, not to say revolutionary, fancies of the writer—whoever
he is—fancies so radically at war with the well-considered
and well-settled opinions of this age. Let us
proceed, then, to our legitimate thesis, <i>The Universe</i>.</p>

<p>This thesis admits a choice between two modes of discussion:—We
may <i>as</i>cend or <i>de</i>scend. Beginning at our
own point of view—at the Earth on which we stand—we
may pass to the other planets of our system—thence to the
Sun—thence to our system considered collectively—and
thence, through other systems, indefinitely outwards; or,
commencing on high at some point as definite as we can
make it or conceive it, we may come down to the habitation
of Man. Usually—that is to say, in ordinary essays
on Astronomy—the first of these two modes is, with certain
reservation, adopted:—this for the obvious reason that
astronomical <i>facts</i>, merely, and principles, being the object,
that object is best fulfilled in stepping from the known
because proximate, gradually onward to the point where all
certitude becomes lost in the remote. For my present purpose,
however,—that of enabling the mind to take in, as if
from afar and at one glance, a distinct conception of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
<i>individual</i> Universe—it is clear that a descent to small
from great—to the outskirts from the centre (if we could
establish a centre)—to the end from the beginning (if we
could fancy a beginning) would be the preferable course,
but for the difficulty, if not impossibility, of presenting, in
this course, to the unastronomical, a picture at all comprehensible
in regard to such considerations as are involved in
<i>quantity</i>—that is to say, in number, magnitude and distance.</p>

<p>Now, distinctness—intelligibility, at all points, is a primary
feature in my general design. On important topics
it is better to be a good deal prolix than even a very little
obscure. But abstruseness is a quality appertaining to no
subject <i>per se</i>. All are alike, in facility of comprehension,
to him who approaches them by properly graduated steps.
It is merely because a stepping-stone, here and there, is
heedlessly left unsupplied in our road to the Differential
Calculus, that this latter is not altogether as simple a thing
as a sonnet by Mr. Solomon Seesaw.</p>

<p>By way of admitting, then, no <i>chance</i> for misapprehension,
I think it advisable to proceed as if even the more
obvious facts of Astronomy were unknown to the reader.
In combining the two modes of discussion to which I have
referred, I propose to avail myself of the advantages peculiar
to each—and very especially of the <i>iteration in detail</i>
which will be unavoidable as a consequence of the plan.
Commencing with a descent, I shall reserve for the return
upwards those indispensable considerations of <i>quantity</i> to
which allusion has already been made.</p>

<p>Let us begin, then, at once, with that merest of words,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
“Infinity.” This, like “God,” “spirit,” and some other
expressions of which the equivalents exist in all languages,
is by no means the expression of an idea—but of an effort
at one. It stands for the possible attempt at an impossible
conception. Man needed a term by which to point out
the <i>direction</i> of this effort—the cloud behind which lay,
forever invisible, the <i>object</i> of this attempt. A word, in
fine, was demanded, by means of which one human being
might put himself in relation at once with another human
being and with a certain <i>tendency</i> of the human intellect.
Out of this demand arose the word, “Infinity;” which is
thus the representative but of the <i>thought of a thought</i>.</p>

<p>As regards <i>that</i> infinity now considered—the infinity of
space—we often hear it said that “its idea is admitted by
the mind—is acquiesced in—is entertained—on account of
the greater difficulty which attends the conception of a
limit.” But this is merely one of those <i>phrases</i> by which
even profound thinkers, time out of mind, have occasionally
taken pleasure in deceiving <i>themselves</i>. The quibble
lies concealed in the word “difficulty.” “The mind,” we
are told, “entertains the idea of <i>limitless</i>, through the
greater <i>difficulty</i> which it finds in entertaining that of <i>limited</i>,
space.” Now, were the proposition but fairly <i>put</i>, its
absurdity would become transparent at once. Clearly,
there is no mere <i>difficulty</i> in the case. The assertion intended,
if presented <i>according</i> to its intention and without
sophistry, would run thus:—“The mind admits the idea of
limitless, through the greater <i>impossibility</i> of entertaining
that of limited, space.”</p>

<p>It must be immediately seen that this is not a question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of two statements between whose respective credibilities—or
of two arguments between whose respective validities—the
<i>reason</i> is called upon to decide:—it is a matter of two
conceptions, directly conflicting, and each avowedly impossible,
one of which the <i>intellect</i> is supposed to be capable
of entertaining, on account of the greater <i>impossibility</i>
of entertaining the other. The choice is <i>not</i> made between
two difficulties;—it is merely <i>fancied</i> to be made between
two impossibilities. Now of the former, there <i>are</i> degrees—but
of the latter, none:—just as our impertinent letter-writer
has already suggested. A task <i>may</i> be more or less
difficult; but it is either possible or not possible:—there
are no gradations. It <i>might</i> be more <i>difficult</i> to overthrow
the Andes than an ant-hill; but it <i>can</i> be no more <i>impossible</i>
to annihilate the matter of the one than the matter of
the other. A man may jump ten feet with less <i>difficulty</i>
than he can jump twenty, but the <i>impossibility</i> of his leaping
to the moon is not a whit less than that of his leaping
to the dog-star.</p>

<p>Since all this is undeniable: since the choice of the
mind is to be made between <i>impossibilities</i> of conception:
since one impossibility cannot be greater than another:
and since, thus, one cannot be preferred to another: the
philosophers who not only maintain, on the grounds mentioned,
man’s <i>idea</i> of infinity but, on account of such supposititious
idea, <i>infinity itself</i>—are plainly engaged in
demonstrating one impossible thing to be possible by showing
how it is that some one other thing—is impossible too.
This, it will be said, is nonsense; and perhaps it is:—indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
I think it very capital nonsense—but forego all claim
to it as nonsense of mine.</p>

<p>The readiest mode, however, of displaying the fallacy
of the philosophical argument on this question, is by simply
adverting to a <i>fact</i> respecting it which has been hitherto
quite overlooked—the fact that the argument alluded to
both proves and disproves its own proposition. “The mind
is impelled,” say the theologians and others, “to admit a
<i>First Cause</i>, by the superior difficulty it experiences in
conceiving cause beyond cause without end.” The quibble,
as before, lies in the word “difficulty”—but <i>here</i> what
is it employed to sustain? A First Cause. And what is
a First Cause? An ultimate termination of causes. And
what is an ultimate termination of causes? Finity—the
Finite. Thus the one quibble, in two processes, by God
knows how many philosophers, is made to support now
Finity and now Infinity—could it not be brought to support
something besides? As for the quibblers—<i>they</i>, at least,
are insupportable. But—to dismiss them:—what they
prove in the one case is the identical nothing which they
demonstrate in the other.</p>

<p>Of course, no one will suppose that I here contend for
the absolute impossibility of <i>that</i> which we attempt to convey
in the word “Infinity.” My purpose is but to show
the folly of endeavoring to prove Infinity itself or even our
conception of it, by any such blundering ratiocination as
that which is ordinarily employed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as an individual, I may be permitted to
say that <i>I cannot</i> conceive Infinity, and am convinced that
no human being can. A mind not thoroughly self-conscious—not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
accustomed to the introspective analysis of its own
operations—will, it is true, often deceive itself by supposing
that it <i>has</i> entertained the conception of which we speak.
In the effort to entertain it, we proceed step beyond step—we
fancy point still beyond point; and so long as we <i>continue</i>
the effort, it may be said, in fact, that we are <i>tending</i>
to the formation of the idea designed; while the strength
of the impression that we actually form or have formed it,
is in the ratio of the period during which we keep up the
mental endeavor. But it is in the act of discontinuing
the endeavor—of fulfilling (as we think) the idea—of
putting the finishing stroke (as we suppose) to the conception—that
we overthrow at once the whole fabric of our
fancy by resting upon some one ultimate and therefore definite
point. This fact, however, we fail to perceive, on
account of the absolute coincidence, in time, between the
settling down upon the ultimate point and the act of cessation
in thinking.—In attempting, on the other hand, to
frame the idea of a <i>limited</i> space, we merely converse the
processes which involve the impossibility.</p>

<p>We <i>believe</i> in a God. We may or may not <i>believe</i> in
finite or in infinite space; but our belief, in such cases, is
more properly designated as <i>faith</i>, and is a matter quite
distinct from that belief proper—from that <i>intellectual</i> belief—which
presupposes the mental conception.</p>

<p>The fact is, that, upon the enunciation of any one of that
class of terms to which “Infinity” belongs—the class representing
<i>thoughts of thought</i>—he who has a right to say
that he thinks <i>at all</i>, feels himself called upon, <i>not</i> to entertain
a conception, but simply to direct his mental vision<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
toward some given point, in the intellectual firmament,
where lies a nebula never to be resolved. To solve it, indeed,
he makes no effort; for with a rapid instinct he comprehends,
not only the impossibility, but, as regards all
human purposes, the <i>inessentiality</i>, of its solution. He perceives
that the Deity has not <i>designed</i> it to be solved. He
sees, at once, that it lies <i>out</i> of the brain of man, and even
<i>how</i>, if not exactly <i>why</i>, it lies out of it. There <i>are</i> people,
I am aware, who, busying themselves in attempts at the
unattainable, acquire very easily, by dint of the jargon they
emit, among those thinkers-that-they-think with whom
darkness and depth are synonymous, a kind of cuttle-fish
reputation for profundity; but the finest quality of Thought
is its self-cognizance; and, with some little equivocation,
it may be said that no fog of the mind can well be greater
than that which, extending to the very boundaries of the
mental domain, shuts out even these boundaries themselves
from comprehension.</p>

<p>It will now be understood that, in using the phrase,
“Infinity of Space,” I make no call upon the reader to
entertain the impossible conception of an <i>absolute</i> infinity.
I refer simply to the “<i>utmost conceivable expanse</i>” of space—a
shadowy and fluctuating domain, now shrinking, now
swelling, in accordance with the vacillating energies of the
imagination.</p>

<p><i>Hitherto</i>, the Universe of stars has always been considered
as coincident with the Universe proper, as I have
defined it in the commencement of this Discourse. It has
been always either directly or indirectly assumed—at least
since the dawn of intelligible Astronomy—that, were it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
possible for us to attain any given point in space, we should
still find, on all sides of us, an interminable succession of
stars. This was the untenable idea of Pascal when making
perhaps the most successful attempt ever made, at periphrasing
the conception for which we struggle in the word
“Universe.” “It is a sphere,” he says, “of which the
centre is everywhere, the circumference, nowhere.” But
although this intended definition is, in fact, <i>no</i> definition of
the Universe of <i>stars</i>, we may accept it, with some mental
reservation, as a definition (rigorous enough for all practical
purposes) of the Universe <i>proper</i>—that is to say, of the
Universe of <i>space</i>. This latter, then, let us regard as “<i>a
sphere of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference
nowhere</i>.” In fact, while we find it impossible to fancy an
<i>end</i> to space, we have no difficulty in picturing to ourselves
any one of an infinity of <i>beginnings</i>.</p>

<p>As our starting-point, then, let us adopt the <i>Godhead</i>.
Of this Godhead, <i>in itself</i>, he alone is not imbecile—he
alone is not impious who propounds—nothing. “<i>Nous ne
connaissons rien</i>,” says the Baron de Bielfeld—“<i>Nous ne
connaissons rien de la nature ou de l’essence de Dieu:—pour
savoir ce qu’il est, il faut être Dieu même.</i>”—“We
know absolutely <i>nothing</i> of the nature or essence of God:—in
order to comprehend what he is, we should have to be
God ourselves.”</p>

<p>“<i>We should have to be God ourselves!</i>”—With a phrase
so startling as this yet ringing in my ears, I nevertheless venture
to demand if this our present ignorance of the Deity is
an ignorance to which the soul is <i>everlastingly</i> condemned.</p>

<p>By <i>Him</i>, however—<i>now</i>, at least, the Incomprehensible—by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Him—assuming him as <i>Spirit</i>—that is to say, as <i>not
Matter</i>—a distinction which, for all intelligible purposes,
will stand well instead of a definition—by Him, then, existing
as Spirit, let us content ourselves, to-night, with supposing
to have been <i>created</i>, or made out of Nothing, by
dint of his Volition—at some point of Space which we will
take as a centre—at some period into which we do not
pretend to inquire, but at all events immensely remote—by
Him, then again, let us suppose to have been created——<i>what</i>?
This is a vitally momentous epoch in our considerations.
<i>What</i> is it that we are justified—that alone we are
justified in supposing to have been, primarily and solely,
<i>created</i>?</p>

<p>We have attained a point where only <i>Intuition</i> can aid
us:—but now let me recur to the idea which I have already
suggested as that alone which we can properly entertain of
intuition. It is but <i>the conviction arising from those inductions
or deductions of which the processes are so shadowy
as to escape our consciousness, elude our reason, or defy our
capacity of expression</i>. With this understanding, I now
assert—that an intuition altogether irresistible, although
inexpressible, forces me to the conclusion that what God
originally created—that that Matter which, by dint of his
Volition, he first made from his Spirit, or from Nihility,
<i>could</i> have been nothing but Matter in its utmost conceivable
state of——what?—of <i>Simplicity</i>?</p>

<p>This will be found the sole absolute <i>assumption</i> of my
Discourse. I use the word “assumption” in its ordinary
sense; yet I maintain that even this my primary proposition,
is very, very far indeed, from being really a mere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
assumption. Nothing was ever more certainly—no human
conclusion was ever, in fact, more regularly—more rigorously
<i>de</i>duced:—but, alas! the processes lie out of the
human analysis—at all events are beyond the utterance of
the human tongue.</p>

<p>Let us now endeavor to conceive what Matter must be,
when, or if, in its absolute extreme of <i>Simplicity</i>. Here
the Reason flies at once to Imparticularity—to a particle—to
<i>one</i> particle—a particle of <i>one</i> kind—of <i>one</i> character—of
<i>one</i> nature—of <i>one size</i>—of one form—a particle, therefore,
“<i>without</i> form and void”—a particle positively a particle
at all points—a particle absolutely unique, individual,
undivided, and not indivisible only because He who <i>created</i>
it, by dint of his Will, can by an infinitely less energetic
exercise of the same Will, as a matter of course, divide it.</p>

<p><i>Oneness</i>, then, is all that I predicate of the originally
created Matter; but I propose to show that this <i>Oneness
is a principle abundantly sufficient to account for the constitution,
the existing phænomena and the plainly inevitable
annihilation of at least the material Universe</i>.</p>

<p>The willing into being the primordial particle, has completed
the act, or more properly the <i>conception</i>, of Creation.
We now proceed to the ultimate purpose for which we are
to suppose the Particle created—that is to say, the ultimate
purpose so far as our considerations <i>yet</i> enable us to see it—the
constitution of the Universe from it, the Particle.</p>

<p>This constitution has been effected by <i>forcing</i> the originally
and therefore normally <i>One</i> into the abnormal condition
of <i>Many</i>. An action of this character implies rëaction.
A diffusion from Unity, under the conditions, involves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a tendency to return into Unity—a tendency ineradicable
until satisfied. But on these points I will speak more fully
hereafter.</p>

<p>The assumption of absolute Unity in the primordial
Particle includes that of infinite divisibility. Let us conceive
the Particle, then, to be only not totally exhausted by
diffusion into Space. From the one Particle, as a centre,
let us suppose to be irradiated spherically—in all directions—to
immeasurable but still to definite distances in the previously
vacant space—a certain inexpressibly great yet
limited number of unimaginably yet not infinitely minute
atoms.</p>

<p>Now, of these atoms, thus diffused, or upon diffusion,
what conditions are we permitted—not to assume, but to
infer, from consideration as well of their source as of the
character of the design apparent in their diffusion? <i>Unity</i>
being their source, and <i>difference from Unity</i> the character
of the design manifested in their diffusion, we are warranted
in supposing this character to be at least <i>generally</i> preserved
throughout the design, and to form a portion of the
design itself:—that is to say, we shall be warranted in conceiving
continual differences at all points from the uniquity
and simplicity of the origin. But, for these reasons, shall
we be justified in imagining the atoms heterogeneous, dissimilar,
unequal, and inequidistant? More explicitly—are
we to consider no two atoms as, at their diffusion, of the
same nature, or of the same form, or of the same size?—and,
after fulfilment of their diffusion into Space, is absolute
inequidistance, each from each, to be understood of all of
them? In such arrangement, under such conditions, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
most easily and immediately comprehend the subsequent
most feasible carrying out to completion of any such design
as that which I have suggested—the design of variety out
of unity—diversity out of sameness—heterogeneity out of
homogeneity—complexity out of simplicity—in a word, the
utmost possible multiplicity of <i>relation</i> out of the emphatically
irrelative <i>One</i>. Undoubtedly, therefore, we <i>should</i> be
warranted in assuming all that has been mentioned, but for
the reflection, first, that supererogation is not presumable
of any Divine Act; and, secondly, that the object supposed
in view, appears as feasible when some of the conditions
in question are dispensed with, in the beginning, as when
all are understood immediately to exist. I mean to say
that some are involved in the rest, or so instantaneous a
consequence of them as to make the distinction inappreciable.
Difference of <i>size</i>, for example, will at once be
brought about through the tendency of one atom to a
second, in preference to a third, on account of particular
inequidistance; which is to be comprehended as <i>particular
inequidistances between centres of quantity, in neighboring
atoms of different form</i>—a matter not at all interfering
with the generally-equable distribution of the atoms. Difference
of <i>kind</i>, too, is easily conceived to be merely a
result of differences in size and form, taken more or less
conjointly:—in fact, since the <i>Unity</i> of the Particle Proper
implies absolute homogeneity, we cannot imagine the atoms,
at their diffusion, differing in kind, without imagining, at
the same time, a special exercise of the Divine Will, at the
emission of each atom, for the purpose of effecting, in each,
a change of its essential nature:—so fantastic an idea is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the less to be indulged, as the object proposed is seen to be
thoroughly attainable without such minute and elaborate
interposition. We perceive, therefore, upon the whole,
that it would be supererogatory, and consequently unphilosophical,
to predicate of the atoms, in view of their purposes,
any thing more than <i>difference of form</i> at their dispersion,
with particular inequidistance after it—all other
differences arising at once out of these, in the very first
processes of mass-constitution:—We thus establish the
Universe on a purely <i>geometrical</i> basis. Of course, it is by
no means necessary to assume absolute difference, even of
form, among <i>all</i> the atoms irradiated—any more than absolute
particular inequidistance of each from each. We are
required to conceive merely that no <i>neighboring</i> atoms are
of similar form—no atoms which can ever approximate,
until their inevitable rëunition at the end.</p>

<p>Although the immediate and perpetual <i>tendency</i> of the
disunited atoms to return into their normal Unity, is implied,
as I have said, in their abnormal diffusion; still it is
clear that this tendency will be without consequence—a
tendency and no more—until the diffusive energy, in ceasing
to be exerted, shall leave <i>it</i>, the tendency, free to seek
its satisfaction. The Divine Act, however, being considered
as determinate, and discontinued on fulfilment of the
diffusion, we understand, at once, a <i>rëaction</i>—in other
words, a <i>satisfiable</i> tendency of the disunited atoms to return
into <i>One</i>.</p>

<p>But the diffusive energy being withdrawn, and the rëaction
having commenced in furtherance of the ultimate
design—<i>that of the utmost possible Relation</i>—this design is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
now in danger of being frustrated, in detail, by reason of
that very tendency to return which is to effect its accomplishment
in general. <i>Multiplicity</i> is the object; but there
is nothing to prevent proximate atoms, from lapsing <i>at once</i>,
through the now satisfiable tendency—<i>before</i> the fulfilment
of any ends proposed in multiplicity—into absolute oneness
among themselves:—there is nothing to impede the aggregation
of various <i>unique</i> masses, at various points of space:—in
other words, nothing to interfere with the accumulation
of various masses, each absolutely One.</p>

<p>For the effectual and thorough completion of the general
design, we thus see the necessity for a repulsion of
limited capacity—a separative <i>something</i> which, on withdrawal
of the diffusive Volition, shall at the same time allow
the approach, and forbid the junction, of the atoms;
suffering them infinitely to approximate, while denying
them positive contact; in a word, having the power—<i>up
to a certain epoch</i>—of preventing their <i>coalition</i>, but no
ability to interfere with their <i>coalescence</i> in any respect <i>or
degree</i>. The repulsion, already considered as so peculiarly
limited in other regards, must be understood, let me repeat,
as having power to prevent absolute coalition, <i>only up to a
certain epoch</i>. Unless we are to conceive that the appetite
for Unity among the atoms is doomed to be satisfied <i>never</i>;—unless
we are to conceive that what had a beginning is
to have no end—a conception which cannot <i>really</i> be
entertained, however much we may talk or dream of entertaining
it—we are forced to conclude that the repulsive
influence imagined, will, finally—under pressure of the <i>Unitendency
collectively</i> applied, but never and in no degree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
<i>until</i>, on fulfilment of the Divine purposes, such collective
application shall be naturally made—yield to a force which,
at that ultimate epoch, shall be the superior force precisely
to the extent required, and thus permit the universal subsidence
into the inevitable, because original and therefore
normal, <i>One</i>.—The conditions here to be reconciled are
difficult indeed:—we cannot even comprehend the possibility
of their conciliation;—nevertheless, the apparent impossibility
is brilliantly suggestive.</p>

<p>That the repulsive something actually exists, <i>we see</i>.
Man neither employs, nor knows, a force sufficient to bring
two atoms into contact. This is but the well-established
proposition of the impenetrability of matter. All Experiment
proves—all Philosophy admits it. The <i>design</i> of the
repulsion—the necessity for its existence—I have endeavored
to show; but from all attempt at investigating its
nature have religiously abstained; this on account of an
intuitive conviction that the principle at issue is strictly
spiritual—lies in a recess impervious to our present understanding—lies
involved in a consideration of what now—in
our human state—is <i>not</i> to be considered—in a consideration
of <i>Spirit in itself</i>. I feel, in a word, that here
the God has interposed, and here only, because here and
here only the knot demanded the interposition of the God.</p>

<p>In fact, while the tendency of the diffused atoms to
return into Unity, will be recognized, at once, as the principle
of the Newtonian Gravity, what I have spoken of as
a repulsive influence prescribing limits to the (immediate)
satisfaction of the tendency, will be understood as <i>that</i>
which we have been in the practice of designating now as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
heat, now as magnetism, now as <i>electricity</i>; displaying
our ignorance of its awful character in the vacillation
of the phraseology with which we endeavor to circumscribe
it.</p>

<p>Calling it, merely for the moment, electricity, we know
that all experimental analysis of electricity has given, as an
ultimate result, the principle, or seeming principle, <i>heterogeneity</i>.
<i>Only</i> where things differ is electricity apparent;
and it is presumable that they <i>never</i> differ where it is not
developed at least, if not apparent. Now, this result is in
the fullest keeping with that which I have reached unempirically.
The design of the repulsive influence I have
maintained to be that of preventing immediate Unity among
the diffused atoms; and these atoms are represented as
different each from each. <i>Difference</i> is their character—their
essentiality—just as <i>no-difference</i> was the essentiality
of their source. When we say, then, that an attempt to
bring any two of these atoms together would induce an
effort, on the part of the repulsive influence, to prevent the
contact, we may as well use the strictly convertible sentence
that an attempt to bring together any two differences
will result in a development of electricity. All existing
bodies, of course, are composed of these atoms in proximate
contact, and are therefore to be considered as mere assemblages
of more or fewer differences; and the resistance
made by the repulsive spirit, on bringing together any two
such assemblages, would be in the ratio of the two sums of
the differences in each:—an expression which, when reduced,
is equivalent to this:—<i>The amount of electricity
developed on the approximation of two bodies, is proportional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to the difference between the respective sums of the
atoms of which the bodies are composed.</i> That <i>no</i> two
bodies are absolutely alike, is a simple corollary from all
that has been here said. Electricity, therefore, existing
always, is <i>developed</i> whenever <i>any</i> bodies, but <i>manifested</i>
only when bodies of appreciable difference, are brought into
approximation.</p>

<p>To electricity—so, for the present, continuing to call it—we
<i>may</i> not be wrong in referring the various physical
appearances of light, heat and magnetism; but far less shall
we be liable to err in attributing to this strictly spiritual
principle the more important phænomena of vitality, consciousness
and <i>Thought</i>. On this topic, however, I need
pause <i>here</i> merely to suggest that these phænomena, whether
observed generally or in detail, seem to proceed <i>at
least in the ratio of the heterogeneous</i>.</p>

<p>Discarding now the two equivocal terms, “gravitation”
and “electricity,” let us adopt the more definite expressions,
“<i>attraction</i>” and “<i>repulsion</i>.” The former is the
body; the latter the soul: the one is the material; the
other the spiritual, principle of the Universe. <i>No other
principles exist.</i> <i>All</i> phænomena are referable to one, or
to the other, or to both combined. So rigorously is this the
case—so thoroughly demonstrable is it that attraction and
repulsion are the <i>sole</i> properties through which we perceive
the Universe—in other words, by which Matter is manifested
to Mind—that, for all merely argumentative purposes,
we are fully justified in assuming that matter <i>exists</i> only as
attraction and repulsion—that attraction and repulsion <i>are</i>
matter:—there being no conceivable case in which we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
may not employ the term “matter” and the terms “attraction”
and “repulsion,” taken together, as equivalent,
and therefore convertible, expressions in Logic.</p>

<p>I said, just now, that what I have described as the tendency
of the diffused atoms to return into their original
unity, would be understood as the principle of the Newtonian
law of gravity: and, in fact, there can be little difficulty
in such an understanding, if we look at the Newtonian
gravity in a merely general view, as a force impelling
matter to seek matter; that is to say, when we pay no
attention to the known <i>modus operandi</i> of the Newtonian
force. The general coincidence satisfies us; but, upon looking
closely, we see, in detail, much that appears <i>in</i>coincident,
and much in regard to which no coincidence, at least, is
established. For example; the Newtonian gravity, when
we think of it in certain moods, does <i>not</i> seem to be a tendency
to <i>oneness</i> at all, but rather a tendency of all bodies
in all directions—a phrase apparently expressive of a tendency
to diffusion. Here, then, is an <i>in</i>coincidence. Again;
when we reflect on the mathematical <i>law</i> governing the
Newtonian tendency, we see clearly that no coincidence
has been made good, in respect of the <i>modus operandi</i>, at
least, between gravitation as known to exist and that seemingly
simple and direct tendency which I have assumed.</p>

<p>In fact, I have attained a point at which it will be advisable
to strengthen my position by reversing my processes.
So far, we have gone on <i>à priori</i>, from an abstract
consideration of <i>Simplicity</i>, as that quality most likely to
have characterized the original action of God. Let us now
see whether the established facts of the Newtonian Gravitation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
may not afford us, <i>à posteriori</i>, some legitimate inductions.</p>

<p>What does the Newtonian law declare?—That all bodies
attract each other with forces proportional to their
quantities of matter and inversely proportional to the squares
of their distances. Purposely, I have here given, in the
first place, the vulgar version of the law; and I confess
that in this, as in most other vulgar versions of great truths,
we find little of a suggestive character. Let us now adopt
a more philosophical phraseology:—<i>Every atom, of every
body, attracts every other atom, both of its own and of every
other body, with a force which varies inversely as the squares
of the distances between the attracting and attracted atom.</i>—Here,
indeed, a flood of suggestion bursts upon the mind.</p>

<p>But let us see distinctly what it was that Newton
<i>proved</i>—according to the grossly irrational definitions of
<i>proof</i> prescribed by the metaphysical schools. He was
forced to content himself with showing how thoroughly the
motions of an imaginary Universe, composed of attracting
and attracted atoms obedient to the law he announced,
coincide with those of the actually existing Universe so far
as it comes under our observation. This was the amount
of his <i>demonstration</i>—that is to say, this was the amount
of it, according to the conventional cant of the “philosophies.”
His successes added proof multiplied by proof—such
proof as a sound intellect admits—but the <i>demonstration</i>
of the law itself, persist the metaphysicians, had not
been strengthened in any degree. “<i>Ocular</i>, <i>physical</i> proof,”
however, of attraction, here upon Earth, in accordance
with the Newtonian theory, was, at length, much to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
satisfaction of some intellectual grovellers, afforded. This
proof arose collaterally and incidentally (as nearly all important
truths have arisen) out of an attempt to ascertain
the mean density of the Earth. In the famous Maskelyne,
Cavendish and Bailly experiments for this purpose, the attraction
of the mass of a mountain was seen, felt, measured,
and found to be mathematically consistent with the
immortal theory of the British astronomer.</p>

<p>But in spite of this confirmation of that which needed
none—in spite of the so-called corroboration of the “theory”
by the so-called “ocular and physical proof”—in spite of
the <i>character</i> of this corroboration—the ideas which even
really philosophical men cannot help imbibing of gravity—and,
especially, the ideas of it which ordinary men get and
contentedly maintain, are <i>seen</i> to have been derived, for
the most part, from a consideration of the principle as they
find it developed—<i>merely in the planet upon which they
stand</i>.</p>

<p>Now, to what does so partial a consideration tend—to
what species of error does it give rise? On the Earth we
<i>see</i> and <i>feel</i>, only that gravity impels all bodies towards the
<i>centre</i> of the Earth. No man in the common walks of life
could be <i>made</i> to see or to feel anything else—could be
made to perceive that anything, anywhere, has a perpetual,
gravitating tendency in any <i>other</i> direction than to the
centre of the Earth; yet (with an exception hereafter to be
specified) it is a fact that every earthly thing (not to speak
now of every heavenly thing) has a tendency not <i>only</i> to
the Earth’s centre but in every conceivable direction besides.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, although the philosophic cannot be said to <i>err
with</i> the vulgar in this matter, they nevertheless permit
themselves to be influenced, without knowing it, by the
<i>sentiment</i> of the vulgar idea. “Although the Pagan fables
are not believed,” says Bryant, in his very erudite “Mythology,”
“yet we forget ourselves continually and make
inferences from them as from existing realities.” I mean
to assert that the merely <i>sensitive perception</i> of gravity as
we experience it on Earth, beguiles mankind into the fancy
of <i>concentralization</i> or <i>especiality</i> respecting it—has been
continually biasing towards this fancy even the mightiest
intellects—perpetually, although imperceptibly, leading them
away from the real characteristics of the principle; thus
preventing them, up to this date, from ever getting a glimpse
of that vital truth which lies in a diametrically opposite
direction—behind the principle’s <i>essential</i> characteristics—those,
<i>not</i> of concentralization or especiality—but of <i>universality</i>
and <i>diffusion</i>. This “vital truth” is <i>Unity</i> as
the <i>source</i> of the phænomenon.</p>

<p>Let me now repeat the definition of gravity:—<i>Every
atom, of every body, attracts every other atom, both of its
own and of every other body</i>, with a force which varies
inversely as the squares of the distances of the attracting
and attracted atom.</p>

<p>Here let the reader pause with me, for a moment, in
contemplation of the miraculous—of the ineffable—of the
altogether unimaginable complexity of relation involved in
the fact that <i>each atom attracts every other atom</i>—involved
merely in this fact of the attraction, without reference to
the law or mode in which the attraction is manifested—involved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
<i>merely</i> in the fact that each atom attracts every
other atom <i>at all</i>, in a wilderness of atoms so numerous
that those which go to the composition of a cannon-ball,
exceed, probably, in mere point of number, all the stars
which go to the constitution of the Universe.</p>

<p>Had we discovered, simply, that each atom tended to
some one favorite point—to some especially attractive atom—we
should still have fallen upon a discovery which, in
itself, would have sufficed to overwhelm the mind:—but
what is it that we are actually called upon to comprehend?
That each atom attracts—sympathizes with the most delicate
movements of every other atom, and with each and
with all at the same time, and forever, and according to a
determinate law of which the complexity, even considered
by itself solely, is utterly beyond the grasp of the imagination
of man. If I propose to ascertain the influence of one
mote in a sunbeam upon its neighboring mote, I cannot
accomplish my purpose without first counting and weighing
all the atoms in the Universe and defining the precise
positions of all at one particular moment. If I venture to
displace, by even the billionth part of an inch, the microscopical
speck of dust which lies now upon the point of my
finger, what is the character of that act upon which I have
adventured? I have done a deed which shakes the Moon
in her path, which causes the Sun to be no longer the Sun,
and which alters forever the destiny of the multitudinous
myriads of stars that roll and glow in the majestic presence
of their Creator.</p>

<p><i>These</i> ideas—conceptions such as <i>these</i>—unthoughtlike
thoughts—soul-reveries rather than conclusions or even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
considerations of the intellect:—ideas, I repeat, such as
these, are such as we can alone hope profitably to entertain
in any effort at grasping the great principle, <i>Attraction</i>.</p>

<p>But now,—<i>with</i> such ideas—with such a <i>vision</i> of the
marvellous complexity of Attraction fairly in his mind—let
any person competent of thought on such topics as these,
set himself to the task of imagining a <i>principle</i> for the phænomena
observed—a condition from which they sprang.</p>

<p>Does not so evident a brotherhood among the atoms
point to a common parentage? Does not a sympathy so
omniprevalent, so ineradicable, and so thoroughly irrespective,
suggest a common paternity as its source? Does not
one extreme impel the reason to the other? Does not the
infinitude of division refer to the utterness of individuality?
Does not the entireness of the complex hint at the perfection
of the simple? It is <i>not</i> that the atoms, as we see
them, are divided or that they are complex in their relations—but
that they are inconceivably divided and unutterably
complex:—it is the extremeness of the conditions to
which I now allude, rather than to the conditions themselves.
In a word, is it not because the atoms were, at
some remote epoch of time, even <i>more than together</i>—is it
not because originally, and therefore normally, they were
<i>One</i>—that now, in all circumstances—at all points—in all
directions—by all modes of approach—in all relations and
through all conditions—they struggle <i>back</i> to this absolutely,
this irrelatively, this unconditionally <i>one</i>?</p>

<p>Some person may here demand:—“Why—since it is to
the <i>One</i> that the atoms struggle back—do we not find and
define Attraction ‘a merely general tendency to a centre?’—why,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in especial, do not <i>your</i> atoms—the atoms which
you describe as having been irradiated from a centre—proceed
at once, rectilinearly, back to the central point of
their origin?”</p>

<p>I reply that <i>they do</i>; as will be distinctly shown; but
that the cause of their so doing is quite irrespective of the
centre <i>as such</i>. They all tend rectilinearly towards a centre,
because of the sphereicity with which they have been
irradiated into space. Each atom, forming one of a generally
uniform globe of atoms, finds more atoms in the direction
of the centre, of course, than in any other, and in that
direction, therefore, is impelled—but is <i>not</i> thus impelled
because the centre is <i>the point of its origin</i>. It is not to
any <i>point</i> that the atoms are allied. It is not any <i>locality</i>,
either in the concrete or in the abstract, to which I suppose
them bound. Nothing like <i>location</i> was conceived as their
origin. Their source lies in the principle, <i>Unity</i>. <i>This</i> is
their lost parent. <i>This</i> they seek always—immediately—in
all directions—wherever it is even partially to be found;
thus appeasing, in some measure, the ineradicable tendency,
while on the way to its absolute satisfaction in the end.
It follows from all this, that any principle which shall be
adequate to account for the <i>law</i>, or <i>modus operandi</i>, of the
attractive force in general, will account for this law in
particular:—that is to say, any principle which will show
why the atoms should tend to their <i>general centre of irradiation</i>
with forces inversely proportional to the squares of
the distances, will be admitted as satisfactorily accounting,
at the same time, for the tendency, according to the same
law, of these atoms each to each:—<i>for</i> the tendency to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
centre <i>is</i> merely the tendency each to each, and not any
tendency to a centre as such.—Thus it will be seen, also,
that the establishment of my propositions would involve no
<i>necessity</i> of modification in the terms of the Newtonian
definition of Gravity, which declares that each atom attracts
each other atom and so forth, and declares this merely;
but (always under the supposition that what I propose be,
in the end, admitted) it seems clear that some error might
occasionally be avoided, in the future processes of Science,
were a more ample phraseology adopted:—for instance:—“Each
atom tends to every other atom &amp;c. with a force
&amp;c.: <i>the general result being a tendency of all, with a similar
force, to a general centre</i>.”</p>

<p>The reversal of our processes has thus brought us to an
identical result; but, while in the one process <i>intuition</i>
was the starting-point, in the other it was the goal. In
commencing the former journey I could only say that, with
an irresistible intuition, I <i>felt</i> Simplicity to have been the
characteristic of the original action of God:—in ending the
latter I can only declare that, with an irresistible intuition,
I perceive Unity to have been the source of the observed
phænomena of the Newtonian gravitation. Thus, according
to the schools, I <i>prove</i> nothing. So be it:—I design
but to suggest—and to <i>convince</i> through the suggestion.
I am proudly aware that there exist many of the most profound
and cautiously discriminative human intellects which
cannot <i>help</i> being abundantly content with my—suggestions.
To these intellects—as to my own—there is no
mathematical demonstration which <i>could</i> bring the least
additional <i>true proof</i> of the great <i>Truth</i> which I have advanced—<i>the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
truth of Original Unity as the source—as the
principle of the Universal Phænomena</i>. For my part, I
am not so sure that I speak and see—I am not so sure that
my heart beats and that my soul lives:—of the rising of
to-morrow’s sun—a probability that as yet lies in the Future—I
do not pretend to be one thousandth part as sure—as
I am of the irretrievably by-gone <i>Fact</i> that All Things
and All Thoughts of Things, with all their ineffable Multiplicity
of Relation, sprang at once into being from the
primordial and irrelative <i>One</i>.</p>

<p>Referring to the Newtonian Gravity, Dr. Nichol, the
eloquent author of “The Architecture of the Heavens,”
says:—“In truth we have no reason to suppose this great
Law, as now revealed, to be the ultimate or simplest, and
therefore the universal and all-comprehensive, form of a
great Ordinance. The mode in which its intensity diminishes
with the element of distance, has not the aspect of
an ultimate <i>principle</i>; which always assumes the simplicity
and self-evidence of those axioms which constitute the
basis of Geometry.”</p>

<p>Now, it is quite true that “ultimate principles,” in the
common understanding of the words, always assume the
simplicity of geometrical axioms—(as for “self-evidence,”
there is no such thing)—but these principles are clearly <i>not</i>
“ultimate;” in other terms what we are in the habit of
calling principles are no principles, properly speaking—since
there can be but one <i>principle</i>, the Volition of God.
We have no right to assume, then, from what we observe
in rules that we choose foolishly to name “principles,”
anything at all in respect to the characteristics of a principle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
proper. The “ultimate principles” of which Dr. Nichol
speaks as having geometrical simplicity, may and do have
this geometrical turn, as being part and parcel of a vast
geometrical system, and thus a system of simplicity itself—in
which, nevertheless, the <i>truly</i> ultimate principle is, <i>as
we know</i>, the consummation of the complex—that is to say,
of the unintelligible—for is it not the Spiritual Capacity of
God?</p>

<p>I quoted Dr. Nichol’s remark, however, not so much to
question its philosophy, as by way of calling attention to
the fact that, while all men have admitted <i>some</i> principle
as existing behind the Law of Gravity, no attempt has been
yet made to point out what this principle in particular <i>is</i>:—if
we except, perhaps, occasional fantastic efforts at referring
it to Magnetism, or Mesmerism, or Swedenborgianism,
or Transcendentalism, or some other equally delicious <i>ism</i>
of the same species, and invariably patronized by one and
the same species of people. The great mind of Newton,
while boldly grasping the Law itself, shrank from the principle
of the Law. The more fluent and comprehensive at
least, if not the more patient and profound, sagacity of
Laplace, had not the courage to attack it. But hesitation
on the part of these two astronomers it is, perhaps, not so
very difficult to understand. They, as well as all the first
class of mathematicians, were mathematicians <i>solely</i>:—their
intellect, at least, had a firmly-pronounced mathematico-physical
tone. What lay not distinctly within the
domain of Physics, or of Mathematics, seemed to them either
Non-Entity or Shadow. Nevertheless, we may well wonder
that Leibnitz, who was a marked exception to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
general rule in these respects, and whose mental temperament
was a singular admixture of the mathematical with
the physico-metaphysical, did not at once investigate and
establish the point at issue. Either Newton or Laplace,
seeking a principle and discovering none <i>physical</i>, would
have rested contentedly in the conclusion that there was
absolutely none; but it is almost impossible to fancy, of
Leibnitz, that, having exhausted in his search the physical
dominions, he would not have stepped at once, boldly and
hopefully, amid his old familiar haunts in the kingdom of
Metaphysics. Here, indeed, it is clear that he <i>must</i> have
adventured in search of the treasure:—that he did not find
it after all, was, perhaps, because his fairy guide, Imagination,
was not sufficiently well-grown, or well-educated, to
direct him aright.</p>

<p>I observed, just now, that, in fact, there had been certain
vague attempts at referring Gravity to some very uncertain
<i>isms</i>. These attempts, however, although considered
bold and justly so considered, looked no farther than
to the generality—the merest generality—of the Newtonian
Law. Its <i>modus operandi</i> has never, to my knowledge,
been approached in the way of an effort at explanation.
It is, therefore, with no unwarranted fear of being taken
for a madman at the outset, and before I can bring my
propositions fairly to the eye of those who alone are competent
to decide upon them, that I here declare the <i>modus
operandi</i> of the Law of Gravity to be an exceedingly simple
and perfectly explicable thing—that is to say, when we
make our advances towards it in just gradations and in the
true direction—when we regard it from the proper point
of view.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether we reach the idea of absolute <i>Unity</i> as the
source of All Things, from a consideration of Simplicity as
the most probable characteristic of the original action of
God;—whether we arrive at it from an inspection of the
universality of relation in the gravitating phænomena;—or
whether we attain it as a result of the mutual corroboration
afforded by both processes;—still, the idea itself, if
entertained at all, is entertained in inseparable connection
with another idea—that of the condition of the Universe
of stars as we <i>now</i> perceive it—that is to say, a condition
of immeasurable <i>diffusion</i> through space. Now a connection
between these two ideas—unity and diffusion—cannot
be established unless through the entertainment of a third
idea—that of <i>irradiation</i>. Absolute Unity being taken as
a centre, then the existing Universe of stars is the result of
<i>irradiation</i> from that centre.</p>

<p>Now, the laws of irradiation are <i>known</i>. They are
part and parcel of the <i>sphere</i>. They belong to the class of
<i>indisputable geometrical properties</i>. We say of them,
“they are true—they are evident.” To demand <i>why</i> they
are true, would be to demand why the axioms are true
upon which their demonstration is based. <i>Nothing</i> is demonstrable,
strictly speaking; but <i>if</i> anything <i>be</i>, then the
properties—the laws in question are demonstrated.</p>

<p>But these laws—what do they declare? Irradiation—how—by
what steps does it proceed outwardly from a
centre?</p>

<p>From a <i>luminous</i> centre, <i>Light</i> issues by irradiation;
and the quantities of light received upon any given plane,
supposed to be shifting its position so as to be now nearer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the centre and now farther from it, will be diminished in
the same proportion as the squares of the distances of the
plane from the luminous body, are increased; and will be
increased in the same proportion as these squares are
diminished.</p>

<p>The expression of the law may be thus generalized:—the
number of light-particles (or, if the phrase be preferred,
the number of light-impressions) received upon the shifting
plane, will be <i>inversely</i> proportional with the squares of the
distances of the plane. Generalizing yet again, we may
say that the diffusion—the scattering—the irradiation, in a
word—is <i>directly</i> proportional with the squares of the distances.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i050.jpg" width="400" height="191" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>For example: at the distance B, from the luminous
centre A, a certain number of particles are so diffused as to
occupy the surface B. Then at double the distance—that
is to say
at C—they will be so much farther diffused as to occupy
four such surfaces:—at treble the distance, or at D, they
will be so much farther separated as to occupy nine such
surfaces:—while, at quadruple the distance, or at E, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
will have become so scattered as to spread themselves over
sixteen such surfaces—and so on forever.</p>

<p>In saying, generally, that the irradiation proceeds in
direct proportion with the squares of the distances, we use
the term irradiation to express <i>the degree of the diffusion</i>
as we proceed outwardly from the centre. Conversing the
idea, and employing the word “concentralization” to express
<i>the degree of the drawing together</i> as we come back
toward the centre from an outward position, we may say
that concentralization proceeds <i>inversely</i> as the squares of
the distances. In other words, we have reached the conclusion
that, on the hypothesis that matter was originally
irradiated from a centre and is now returning to it, the
concentralization, in the return, proceeds <i>exactly as we
know the force of gravitation to proceed</i>.</p>

<p>Now here, if we could be permitted to assume that concentralization
exactly represented the <i>force of the tendency
to the centre</i>—that the one was exactly proportional to the
other, and that the two proceeded together—we should
have shown all that is required. The sole difficulty existing,
then, is to establish a direct proportion between “concentralization”
and the <i>force</i> of concentralization; and
this is done, of course, if we establish such proportion between
“irradiation” and the <i>force</i> of irradiation.</p>

<p>A very slight inspection of the Heavens assures us that
the stars have a certain general uniformity, equability, or
equidistance, of distribution through that region of space in
which, collectively, and in a roughly globular form, they
are situated:—this species of very general, rather than absolute,
equability, being in full keeping with my deduction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of inequidistance, within certain limits, among the originally
diffused atoms, as a corollary from the evident design
of infinite complexity of relation out of irrelation. I started,
it will be remembered, with the idea of a generally uniform
but particularly <i>un</i>uniform distribution of the atoms;—an
idea, I repeat, which an inspection of the stars, as they
exist, confirms.</p>

<p>But even in the merely general equability of distribution,
as regards the atoms, there appears a difficulty which,
no doubt, has already suggested itself to those among my
readers who have borne in mind that I suppose this equability
of distribution effected through <i>irradiation from a centre</i>.
The very first glance at the idea, irradiation, forces
us to the entertainment of the hitherto unseparated and
seemingly inseparable idea of agglomeration about a centre,
with dispersion as we recede from it—the idea, in a word,
of <i>in</i>equability of distribution in respect to the matter irradiated.</p>

<p>Now, I have elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> observed that it is by just such
difficulties as the one now in question—such roughnesses—such
peculiarities—such protuberances above the plane of
the ordinary—that Reason feels her way, if at all, in her
search for the True. By the difficulty—the “peculiarity”—now
presented, I leap at once to <i>the</i> secret—a secret
which I might never have attained <i>but</i> for the peculiarity
and the inferences which, <i>in its mere character of peculiarity</i>,
it affords me.</p>

<p>The process of thought, at this point, may be thus
roughly sketched:—I say to myself—“Unity, as I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>explained it, is a truth—I feel it. Diffusion is a truth—I
see it. Irradiation, by which alone these two truths are
reconciled, is a consequent truth—I perceive it. <i>Equability</i>
of diffusion, first deduced <i>à priori</i> and then corroborated
by the inspection of phænomena, is also a truth—I fully
admit it. So far all is clear around me:—there are no
clouds behind which <i>the</i> secret—the great secret of the
gravitating <i>modus operandi</i>—can possibly lie hidden;—but
this secret lies <i>hereabouts</i>, most assuredly; and <i>were</i> there
but a cloud in view, I should be driven to suspicion of that
cloud.” And now, just as I say this, there actually comes
a cloud into view. This cloud is the seeming impossibility
of reconciling my truth, <i>irradiation</i>, with my truth, <i>equability
of diffusion</i>. I say now:—“Behind this <i>seeming</i>
impossibility is to be found what I desire.” I do not say
“<i>real</i> impossibility;” for invincible faith in my truths assures
me that it is a mere difficulty after all—but I go on
to say, with unflinching confidence, that, <i>when</i> this <i>difficulty</i>
shall be solved, we shall find, <i>wrapped up in the process of
solution</i>, the key to the secret at which we aim. Moreover—I
<i>feel</i> that we shall discover <i>but one</i> possible solution
of the difficulty; this for the reason that, were there two,
one would be supererogatory—would be fruitless—would be
empty—would contain no key—since no duplicate key can
be needed to any secret of Nature.</p>

<p>And now, let us see:—Our usual notions of irradiation—in
fact <i>all</i> our distinct notions of it—are caught merely
from the process as we see it exemplified in <i>Light</i>. Here
there is a <i>continuous</i> outpouring of <i>ray-streams</i>, and <i>with a
force which we have at least no right to suppose varies at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
all</i>. Now, in any such irradiation <i>as this</i>—continuous and
of unvarying force—the regions nearer the centre must
<i>inevitably</i> be always more crowded with the irradiated
matter than the regions more remote. But I have assumed
<i>no</i> such irradiation <i>as this</i>. I assumed no <i>continuous</i> irradiation;
and for the simple reason that such an assumption
would have involved, first, the necessity of entertaining a
conception which I have shown no man <i>can</i> entertain, and
which (as I will more fully explain hereafter) all observation
of the firmament refutes—the conception of the absolute
infinity of the Universe of stars—and would have
involved, secondly, the impossibility of understanding a
rëaction—that is, gravitation—as existing now—since,
while an act is continued, no rëaction, of course, can take
place. My assumption, then, or rather my inevitable deduction
from just premises—was that of a <i>determinate</i> irradiation—one
finally <i>dis</i>continued.</p>

<p>Let me now describe the sole possible mode in which it
is conceivable that matter could have been diffused through
space, so as to fulfil the conditions at once of irradiation
and of generally equable distribution.</p>

<p>For convenience of illustration, let us imagine, in the
first place, a hollow sphere of glass, or of anything else,
occupying the space throughout which the universal matter
is to be thus equally diffused, by means of irradiation, from
the absolute, irrelative, unconditional particle, placed in the
centre of the sphere.</p>

<p>Now, a certain exertion of the diffusive power (presumed
to be the Divine Volition)—in other words, a certain
<i>force</i>—whose measure is the quantity of matter—that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
is to say, the number of atoms—emitted; emits, by irradiation,
this certain number of atoms; forcing them in all
directions outwardly from the centre—their proximity to
each other diminishing as they proceed—until, finally, they
are distributed, loosely, over the interior surface of the
sphere.</p>

<p>When these atoms have attained this position, or while
proceeding to attain it, a second and inferior exercise of the
same force—or a second and inferior force of the same
character—emits, in the same manner—that is to say, by
irradiation as before—a second stratum of atoms which
proceeds to deposit itself upon the first; the number of
atoms, in this case as in the former, being of course the
measure of the force which emitted them; in other words
the force being precisely adapted to the purpose it effects—the
force and the number of atoms sent out by the force,
being <i>directly proportional</i>.</p>

<p>When this second stratum has reached its destined position—or
while approaching it—a third still inferior exertion
of the force, or a third inferior force of a similar character—the
number of atoms emitted being in <i>all</i> cases the measure
of the force—proceeds to deposit a third stratum upon
the second:—and so on, until these concentric strata, growing
gradually less and less, come down at length to the
central point; and the diffusive matter, simultaneously with
the diffusive force, is exhausted.</p>

<p>We have now the sphere filled, through means of irradiation,
with atoms equably diffused. The two necessary
conditions—those of irradiation and of equable diffusion—are
satisfied; and by the <i>sole</i> process in which the possibility<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of their simultaneous satisfaction is conceivable. For
this reason, I confidently expect to find, lurking in the present
condition of the atoms as distributed throughout the
sphere, the secret of which I am in search—the all-important
principle of the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Newtonian law.
Let us examine, then, the actual condition of the atoms.</p>

<p>They lie in a series of concentric strata. They are
equably diffused throughout the sphere. They have been
irradiated into these states.</p>

<p>The atoms being <i>equably</i> distributed, the greater the
superficial extent of any of these concentric strata, or
spheres, the more atoms will lie upon it. In other words,
the number of atoms lying upon the surface of any one of
the concentric spheres, is directly proportional with the extent
of that surface.</p>

<p><i>But, in any series of concentric spheres, the surfaces
are directly proportional with the squares of the distances
from the centre.</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Therefore the number of atoms in any stratum is directly
proportional with the square of that stratum’s distance
from the centre.</p>

<p>But the number of atoms in any stratum is the measure
of the force which emitted that stratum—that is to say, is
<i>directly proportional</i> with the force.</p>

<p>Therefore the force which irradiated any stratum is
directly proportional with the square of that stratum’s distance
from the centre:—or, generally,</p>

<p><i>The force of the irradiation has been directly proportional
with the squares of the distances.</i></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>Now, Rëaction, as far as we know anything of it, is
Action conversed. The <i>general</i> principle of Gravity being,
in the first place, understood as the rëaction of an act—as
the expression of a desire on the part of Matter, while existing
in a state of diffusion, to return into the Unity whence
it was diffused; and, in the second place, the mind being
called upon to determine the <i>character</i> of the desire—the
manner in which it would, naturally, be manifested; in
other words, being called upon to conceive a probable law,
or <i>modus operandi</i>, for the return; could not well help
arriving at the conclusion that this law of return would be
precisely the converse of the law of departure. That such
would be the case, any one, at least, would be abundantly
justified in taking for granted, until such time as some person
should suggest something like a plausible reason why it
should <i>not</i> be the case—until such period as a law of return
shall be imagined which the intellect can consider as preferable.</p>

<p>Matter, then, irradiated into space with a force varying
as the squares of the distances, might, <i>à priori</i>, be supposed
to return towards its centre of irradiation with a force
varying <i>inversely</i> as the squares of the distances: and I
have already shown<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> that any principle which will explain
why the atoms should tend, according to any law, to the
general centre, must be admitted as satisfactorily explaining,
at the same time, why, according to the same law, they
should tend each to each. For, in fact, the tendency to the
general centre is not to a centre as such, but because of its
being a point in tending towards which each atom tends
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>most directly to its real and essential centre, <i>Unity</i>—the
absolute and final Union of all.</p>

<p>The consideration here involved presents to my own
mind no embarrassment whatever—but this fact does not
blind me to the possibility of its being obscure to those who
may have been less in the habit of dealing with abstractions:—and,
upon the whole, it may be as well to look at
the matter from one or two other points of view.</p>

<p>The absolute, irrelative particle primarily created by the
Volition of God, must have been in a condition of positive
<i>normality</i>, or rightfulness—for wrongfulness implies <i>relation</i>.
Right is positive; wrong is negative—is merely the
negation of right; as cold is the negation of heat—darkness
of light. That a thing may be wrong, it is necessary that
there be some other thing in <i>relation</i> to which it <i>is</i> wrong—some
condition which it fails to satisfy; some law which
it violates; some being whom it aggrieves. If there be no
such being, law, or condition, in respect to which the thing
is wrong—and, still more especially, if no beings, laws, or
conditions exist at all—then the thing can<i>not</i> be wrong and
consequently must be <i>right</i>. Any deviation from normality
involves a tendency to return into it. A difference from
the normal—from the right—from the just—can be understood
as effected only by the overcoming a difficulty; and if
the force which overcomes the difficulty be not infinitely
continued, the ineradicable tendency to return will at
length be permitted to act for its own satisfaction. Upon
withdrawal of the force, the tendency acts. This is the
principle of rëaction as the inevitable consequence of finite
action. Employing a phraseology of which the seeming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
affectation will be pardoned for its expressiveness, we may
say that Rëaction is the return from the condition of <i>as it
is and ought not to be</i> into the condition of <i>as it was, originally,
and therefore ought to be</i>:—and let me add here
that the <i>absolute</i> force of Rëaction would no doubt be
always found in direct proportion with the reality—the
truth—the absoluteness—of the <i>originality</i>—if ever it were
possible to measure this latter:—and, consequently, the
greatest of all conceivable reactions must be that produced
by the tendency which we now discuss—the tendency to
return into the <i>absolutely original</i>—into the <i>supremely</i>
primitive. Gravity, then, <i>must be the strongest of forces</i>—an
idea reached <i>à priori</i> and abundantly confirmed by
induction. What use I make of the idea, will be seen in
the sequel.</p>

<p>The atoms, now, having been diffused from their normal
condition of Unity, seek to return to——what? Not to
any particular <i>point</i>, certainly; for it is clear that if, upon
the diffusion, the whole Universe of matter had been projected,
collectively, to a distance from the point of irradiation,
the atomic tendency to the general centre of the
sphere would not have been disturbed in the least:—the
atoms would not have sought the point <i>in absolute space</i>
from which they were originally impelled. It is merely the
<i>condition</i>, and not the point or locality at which this condition
took its rise, that these atoms seek to re-establish;—it
is merely <i>that condition which is their normality</i>, that
they desire. “But they seek a centre,” it will be said,
“and a centre is a point.” True; but they seek this point
not in its character of point—(for, were the whole sphere
moved from its position, they would seek, equally, the centre;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and the centre <i>then</i> would be a <i>new</i> point)—but because
it so happens, on account of the form in which they
collectively exist—(that of the sphere)—that only <i>through</i>
the point in question—the sphere’s centre—they can attain
their true object, Unity. In the direction of the centre
each atom perceives more atoms than in any other direction.
Each atom is impelled towards the centre because
along the straight line joining it and the centre and passing
on to the circumference beyond, there lie a greater number
of atoms than along any other straight line—a greater number
of objects that seek it, the individual atom—a greater number
of tendencies to Unity—a greater number of satisfactions
for its own tendency to Unity—in a word, because in the
direction of the centre lies the utmost possibility of satisfaction,
generally, for its own individual appetite. To be
brief, the <i>condition</i>, Unity, is all that is really sought; and
if the atoms <i>seem</i> to seek the centre of the sphere, it is only
impliedly, through implication—because such centre happens
to imply, to include, or to involve, the only essential
centre, Unity. But <i>on account of</i> this implication or involution,
there is no possibility of practically separating the
tendency to Unity in the abstract, from the tendency to
the concrete centre. Thus the tendency of the atoms to
the general centre <i>is</i>, to all practical intents and for all
logical purposes, the tendency each to each; and the
tendency each to each <i>is</i> the tendency to the centre; and
the one tendency may be assumed <i>as</i> the other; whatever
will apply to the one must be thoroughly applicable to the
other; and, in conclusion, whatever principle will satisfactorily
explain the one, cannot be questioned as an explanation
of the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>In looking carefully around me for rational objection to
what I have advanced, I am able to discover <i>nothing</i>;—but
of that class of objections usually urged by the doubters
for Doubt’s sake, I very readily perceive <i>three</i>; and proceed
to dispose of them in order.</p>

<p>It may be said, first: “The proof that the force of irradiation
(in the case described) is directly proportional to
the squares of the distances, depends upon an unwarranted
assumption—that of the number of atoms in each stratum
being the measure of the force with which they are
emitted.”</p>

<p>I reply, not only that I am warranted in such assumption,
but that I should be utterly <i>un</i>warranted in any other.
What I assume is, simply, that an effect is the measure of
its cause—that every exercise of the Divine Will will be
proportional to that which demands the exertion—that the
means of Omnipotence, or of Omniscience, will be exactly
adapted to its purposes. Neither can a deficiency nor an
excess of cause bring to pass any effect. Had the force
which irradiated any stratum to its position, been either
more or less than was needed for the purpose—that is to
say, not <i>directly proportional</i> to the purpose—then to its
position that stratum could not have been irradiated. Had
the force which, with a view to general equability of distribution,
emitted the proper number of atoms for each stratum,
been not <i>directly proportional</i> to the number, then the
number would <i>not</i> have been the number demanded for the
equable distribution.</p>

<p>The second supposable objection is somewhat better
entitled to an answer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>It is an admitted principle in Dynamics that every body,
on receiving an impulse, or disposition to move, will move
onward in a straight line, in the direction imparted by the
impelling force, until deflected, or stopped, by some other
force. How then, it may be asked, is my first or external
stratum of atoms to be understood as discontinuing their
movement at the circumference of the imaginary glass
sphere, when no second force, of more than an imaginary
character, appears, to account for the discontinuance?</p>

<p>I reply that the objection, in this case, actually does
arise out of “an unwarranted assumption”—on the part of
the objector—the assumption of a principle, in Dynamics,
at an epoch when <i>no</i> “principles,” in <i>anything</i>, exist:—I
use the word “principle,” of course, in the objector’s
understanding of the word.</p>

<p>“In the beginning” we can admit—indeed we can
comprehend—but one <i>First Cause</i>—the truly ultimate
<i>Principle</i>—the Volition of God. The primary <i>act</i>—that
of Irradiation from Unity—must have been independent of
all that which the world now calls “principle”—because
all that we so designate is but a consequence of the rëaction
of that primary act:—I say “<i>primary</i>” act; for the
creation of the absolute material particle is more properly
to be regarded as a <i>conception</i> than as an “<i>act</i>” in the
ordinary meaning of the term. Thus, we must regard the
primary act as an act for the establishment of what we
now call “principles.” But this primary act itself is to be
considered as <i>continuous Volition</i>. The Thought of God
is to be understood as originating the Diffusion—as proceeding
with it—as regulating it—and, finally, as being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
withdrawn from it upon its completion. <i>Then</i> commences
Rëaction, and through Rëaction, “Principle,” as we employ
the word. It will be advisable, however, to limit the
application of this word to the two <i>immediate</i> results of the
discontinuance of the Divine Volition—that is, to the two
agents, <i>Attraction</i> and <i>Repulsion</i>. Every other Natural
agent depends, either more or less immediately, upon these
two, and therefore would be more conveniently designated
as <i>sub</i>-principle.</p>

<p>It may be objected, thirdly, that, in general, the peculiar
mode of distribution which I have suggested for the atoms,
is “an hypothesis and nothing more.”</p>

<p>Now, I am aware that the word hypothesis is a ponderous
sledge-hammer, grasped immediately, if not lifted, by
all very diminutive thinkers, upon the first appearance of
any proposition wearing, in any particular, the garb of <i>a
theory</i>. But “hypothesis” cannot be wielded <i>here</i> to any
good purpose, even by those who succeed in lifting it—little
men or great.</p>

<p>I maintain, first, that <i>only</i> in the mode described is it
conceivable that Matter could have been diffused so as to
fulfil at once the conditions of irradiation and of generally
equable distribution. I maintain, secondly, that these conditions
themselves have been imposed upon me, as necessities,
in a train of ratiocination <i>as rigorously logical as that
which establishes any demonstration in Euclid</i>; and I
maintain, thirdly, that even if the charge of “hypothesis”
were as fully sustained as it is, in fact, unsustained and
untenable, still the validity and indisputability of my result
would not, even in the slightest particular, be disturbed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>To explain:—The Newtonian Gravity—a law of Nature—a
law whose existence as such no one out of Bedlam
questions—a law whose admission as such enables us to
account for nine-tenths of the Universal phænomena—a
law which, merely because it does so enable us to account
for these phænomena, we are perfectly willing, without
reference to any other considerations, to admit, and cannot
help admitting, as a law—a law, nevertheless, of which
neither the principle nor the <i>modus operandi</i> of the principle,
has ever yet been traced by the human analysis—a
law, in short, which, neither in its detail nor in its generality,
has been found susceptible of explanation <i>at all</i>—is at
length seen to be at every point thoroughly explicable,
provided only we yield our assent to——what? To an
hypothesis? Why <i>if</i> an hypothesis—if the merest hypothesis—if
an hypothesis for whose assumption—as in the
case of that <i>pure</i> hypothesis the Newtonian law itself—no
shadow of <i>à priori</i> reason could be assigned—if an hypothesis,
even so absolute as all this implies, would enable us
to perceive a principle for the Newtonian law—would enable
us to understand as satisfied, conditions so miraculously—so
ineffably complex and seemingly irreconcileable as
those involved in the relations of which Gravity tells us,—what
rational being <i>could</i> so expose his fatuity as to call
even this absolute hypothesis an hypothesis any longer—unless,
indeed, he were to persist in so calling it, with the
understanding that he did so, simply for the sake of consistency
<i>in words</i>?</p>

<p>But what is the true state of our present case? What
is <i>the fact</i>? Not only that it is <i>not</i> an hypothesis which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
we are required <i>to adopt</i>, in order to admit the principle at
issue explained, but that it <i>is</i> a logical conclusion which
we are requested <i>not</i> to adopt if we can avoid it—which
we are simply invited to <i>deny if we can</i>:—a conclusion of
so accurate a logicality that to dispute it would be the effort—to
doubt its validity beyond our power:—a conclusion
from which we see no mode of escape, turn as we will; a
result which confronts us either at the end of an <i>in</i>ductive
journey from the phænomena of the very Law discussed,
or at the close of a <i>de</i>ductive career from the most rigorously
simple of all conceivable assumptions—<i>the assumption,
in a word, of Simplicity itself</i>.</p>

<p>And if here, for the mere sake of cavilling, it be urged,
that although my starting-point is, as I assert, the assumption
of absolute Simplicity, yet Simplicity, considered merely
in itself, is no axiom; and that only deductions from
axioms are indisputable—it is thus that I reply:—</p>

<p>Every other science than Logic is the science of certain
concrete relations. Arithmetic, for example, is the science of
the relations of number—Geometry, of the relations of form—Mathematics
in general, of the relations of quantity in
general—of whatever can be increased or diminished. Logic,
however, is the science of Relation in the abstract—of
absolute Relation—of Relation considered solely in itself.
An axiom in any particular science other than Logic is,
thus, merely a proposition announcing certain concrete
relations which seem to be too obvious for dispute—as
when we say, for instance, that the whole is greater than
its part:—and, thus again, the principle of the <i>Logical</i>
axiom—in other words, of an axiom in the abstract—is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
simply, <i>obviousness of relation</i>. Now, it is clear, not only
that what is obvious to one mind may not be obvious
to another, but that what is obvious to one mind at one
epoch, may be anything but obvious, at another epoch, to
the same mind. It is clear, moreover, that what, to-day,
is obvious even to the majority of mankind, or to the majority
of the best intellects of mankind, may to-morrow be,
to either majority, more or less obvious, or in no respect obvious
at all. It is seen, then, that the <i>axiomatic principle</i>
itself is susceptible of variation, and of course that axioms
are susceptible of similar change. Being mutable, the
“truths” which grow out of them are necessarily mutable
too; or, in other words, are never to be positively depended
upon as truths at all—since Truth and Immutability are one.</p>

<p>It will now be readily understood that no axiomatic
idea—no idea founded in the fluctuating principle, obviousness
of relation—can possibly be so secure—so reliable a
basis for any structure erected by the Reason, as <i>that</i> idea—(whatever
it is, wherever we can find it, or <i>if</i> it be practicable
to find it anywhere)—which is <i>ir</i>relative altogether—which
not only presents to the understanding <i>no obviousness</i>
of relation, either greater or less, to be considered, but
subjects the intellect, not in the slightest degree, to the necessity
of even looking at <i>any relation at all</i>. If such an
idea be not what we too heedlessly term “an axiom,” it is
at least preferable, as a Logical basis, to any axiom ever
propounded, or to all imaginable axioms combined:—and
such, precisely, is the idea with which my deductive process,
so thoroughly corroborated by induction, commences.
My <i>particle proper</i> is but <i>absolute Irrelation</i>. To sum up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
what has been here advanced:—As a starting point I
have taken it for granted, simply, that the Beginning had
nothing behind it or before it—that it was a Beginning in
fact—that it was a beginning and nothing different from a
beginning—in short that this Beginning was——<i>that which
it was</i>. If this be a “mere assumption” then a “mere
assumption” let it be.</p>

<p>To conclude this branch of the subject:—I am fully
warranted in announcing that <i>the Law which we have been
in the habit of calling Gravity exists on account of Matter’s
having been irradiated, at its origin, atomically, into a
limited<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> sphere of Space, from one, individual, unconditional,
irrelative, and absolute Particle Proper, by the sole
process in which it was possible to satisfy, at the same time,
the two conditions, irradiation, and generally-equable distribution
throughout the sphere—that is to say, by a force
varying in direct proportion with the squares of the distances
between the irradiated atoms, respectively, and the
Particular centre of Irradiation</i>.</p>

<p>I have already given my reasons for presuming Matter
to have been diffused by a determinate rather than by a
continuous or infinitely continued force. Supposing a continuous
force, we should be unable, in the first place, to
comprehend a rëaction at all; and we should be required,
in the second place, to entertain the impossible conception
of an infinite extension of Matter. Not to dwell
upon the impossibility of the conception, the infinite extension
of Matter is an idea which, if not positively disproved,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>is at least not in any respect warranted by telescopic
observation of the stars—a point to be explained more fully
hereafter; and this empirical reason for believing in the
original finity of Matter is unempirically confirmed. For
example:—Admitting, for the moment, the possibility of
understanding Space <i>filled</i> with the irradiated atoms—that
is to say, admitting, as well as we can, for argument’s sake,
that the succession of the irradiated atoms had absolutely
<i>no end</i>—then it is abundantly clear that, even when the
Volition of God had been withdrawn from them, and thus
the tendency to return into Unity permitted (abstractly) to
be satisfied, this permission would have been nugatory and
invalid—practically valueless and of no effect whatever.
No Rëaction could have taken place; no movement toward
Unity could have been made; no Law of Gravity could
have obtained.</p>

<p>To explain:—Grant the <i>abstract</i> tendency of any one
atom to any one other as the inevitable result of diffusion
from the normal Unity:—or, what is the same thing, admit
any given atom as <i>proposing</i> to move in any given direction—it
is clear that, since there is an <i>infinity</i> of atoms on
all sides of the atom proposing to move, it never can actually
move toward the satisfaction of its tendency in the direction
given, on account of a precisely equal and counterbalancing
tendency in the direction diametrically opposite.
In other words, exactly as many tendencies to Unity are
behind the hesitating atom as before it; for it is a mere
sotticism to say that one infinite line is longer or shorter
than another infinite line, or that one infinite number is
greater or less than another number that is infinite. Thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the atom in question must remain stationary forever. Under
the impossible circumstances which we have been merely
endeavoring to conceive for argument’s sake, there could
have been no aggregation of Matter—no stars—no worlds—nothing
but a perpetually atomic and inconsequential
Universe. In fact, view it as we will, the whole idea of
unlimited Matter is not only untenable, but impossible and
preposterous.</p>

<p>With the understanding of a <i>sphere</i> of atoms, however,
we perceive, at once, a <i>satisfiable</i> tendency to union. The
general result of the tendency each to each, being a tendency
of all to the centre, the <i>general</i> process of condensation,
or approximation, commences immediately, by a common
and simultaneous movement, on withdrawal of the
Divine Volition; the <i>individual</i> approximations, or coalescences—<i>not</i>
cöalitions—of atom with atom, being subject
to almost infinite variations of time, degree, and condition,
on account of the excessive multiplicity of relation, arising
from the differences of form assumed as characterizing the
atoms at the moment of their quitting the Particle Proper;
as well as from the subsequent particular inequidistance,
each from each.</p>

<p>What I wish to impress upon the reader is the certainty
of there arising, at once, (on withdrawal of the diffusive
force, or Divine Volition,) out of the condition of the atoms
as described, at innumerable points throughout the Universal
sphere, innumerable agglomerations, characterized
by innumerable specific differences of form, size, essential
nature, and distance each from each. The development of
Repulsion (Electricity) must have commenced, of course,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
with the very earliest particular efforts at Unity, and must
have proceeded constantly in the ratio of Coalescence—that
is to say, <i>in that of Condensation</i>, or, again, of Heterogeneity.</p>

<p>Thus the two Principles Proper, <i>Attraction</i> and <i>Repulsion</i>—the
Material and the Spiritual—accompany each
other, in the strictest fellowship, forever. Thus <i>The Body
and The Soul walk hand in hand</i>.</p>

<p>If now, in fancy, we select <i>any one</i> of the agglomerations
considered as in their primary stages throughout the
Universal sphere, and suppose this incipient agglomeration
to be taking place at that point where the centre of our Sun
exists—or rather where it <i>did</i> exist originally; for the Sun
is perpetually shifting his position—we shall find ourselves
met, and borne onward for a time at least, by the most
magnificent of theories—by the Nebular Cosmogony of
Laplace:—although “Cosmogony” is far too comprehensive
a term for what he really discusses—which is the constitution
of our solar system alone—of one among the myriad
of similar systems which make up the Universe Proper—that
Universal sphere—that all-inclusive and absolute
<i>Kosmos</i> which forms the subject of my present Discourse.</p>

<p>Confining himself to an <i>obviously limited</i> region—that
of our solar system with its comparatively immediate vicinity—and
<i>merely</i> assuming—that is to say, assuming without
any basis whatever, either deductive or inductive—<i>much</i>
of what I have been just endeavoring to place upon
a more stable basis than assumption; assuming, for example,
matter as diffused (without pretending to account for
the diffusion) throughout, and somewhat beyond, the space<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
occupied by our system—diffused in a state of heterogeneous
nebulosity and obedient to that omniprevalent law of Gravity
at whose principle he ventured to make no guess;—assuming
all this (which is quite true, although he had no
logical right to its assumption) Laplace has shown, dynamically
and mathematically, that the results in such case
necessarily ensuing, are those and those alone which we
find manifested in the actually existing condition of the
system itself.</p>

<p>To explain:—Let us conceive <i>that</i> particular agglomeration
of which we have just spoken—the one at the point
designated by our Sun’s centre—to have so far proceeded
that a vast quantity of nebulous matter has here assumed a
roughly globular form; its centre being, of course, coincident
with what is now, or rather was originally, the centre
of our Sun; and its periphery extending out beyond the
orbit of Neptune, the most remote of our planets:—in other
words, let us suppose the diameter of this rough sphere to
be some 6000 millions of miles. For ages, this mass of
matter has been undergoing condensation, until at length
it has become reduced into the bulk we imagine; having
proceeded gradually, of course, from its atomic and imperceptible
state, into what we understand of visible, palpable,
or otherwise appreciable nebulosity.</p>

<p>Now, the condition of this mass implies a rotation about
an imaginary axis—a rotation which, commencing with the
absolute incipiency of the aggregation, has been ever since
acquiring velocity. The very first two atoms which met,
approaching each other from points not diametrically opposite,
would, in rushing partially past each other, form a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
nucleus for the rotary movement described. How this
would increase in velocity, is readily seen. The two atoms
are joined by others:—an aggregation is formed. The mass
continues to rotate while condensing. But any atom at the
circumference has, of course, a more rapid motion than one
nearer the centre. The outer atom, however, with its
superior velocity, approaches the centre; carrying this superior
velocity with it as it goes. Thus every atom, proceeding
inwardly, and finally attaching itself to the condensed
centre, adds something to the original velocity of
that centre—that is to say, increases the rotary movement
of the mass.</p>

<p>Let us now suppose this mass so far condensed that it
occupies <i>precisely</i> the space circumscribed by the orbit of
Neptune, and that the velocity with which the surface of
the mass moves, in the general rotation, is precisely that
velocity with which Neptune now revolves about the Sun.
At this epoch, then, we are to understand that the constantly
increasing centrifugal force, having gotten the better
of the non-increasing centripetal, loosened and separated
the exterior and least condensed stratum, or a few of the
exterior and least condensed strata, at the equator of the
sphere, where the tangential velocity predominated; so
that these strata formed about the main body an independent
ring encircling the equatorial regions:—just as the
exterior portion thrown off, by excessive velocity of rotation,
from a grindstone, would form a ring about the grindstone,
but for the solidity of the superficial material: were
this caoutchouc, or anything similar in consistency, precisely
the phænomenon I describe would be presented.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The ring thus whirled from the nebulous mass, <i>revolved</i>,
of course, <i>as</i> a separate ring, with just that velocity with
which, while the surface of the mass, it <i>rotated</i>. In the
meantime, condensation still proceeding, the interval between
the discharged ring and the main body continued to
increase, until the former was left at a vast distance from
the latter.</p>

<p>Now, admitting the ring to have possessed, by some
seemingly accidental arrangement of its heterogeneous materials,
a constitution nearly uniform, then this ring, <i>as</i> such,
would never have ceased revolving about its primary; but,
as might have been anticipated, there appears to have been
enough irregularity in the disposition of the materials, to make
them cluster about centres of superior solidity; and thus the
annular form was destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> No doubt, the band was soon
broken up into several portions, and one of these portions,
predominating in mass, absorbed the others into itself; the
whole settling, spherically, into a planet. That this latter, <i>as</i>
a planet, continued the revolutionary movement which characterized
it while a ring, is sufficiently clear; and that it took
upon itself also, an additional movement in its new condition
of sphere, is readily explained. The ring being understood
as yet unbroken, we see that its exterior, while the
whole revolves about the parent body, moves more rapidly
than its interior. When the rupture occurred, then, some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>portion in each fragment must have been moving with
greater velocity than the others. The superior movement
prevailing, must have whirled each fragment round—that is
to say, have caused it to rotate; and the direction of the
rotation must, of course, have been the direction of the
revolution whence it arose. <i>All</i> the fragments having become
subject to the rotation described, must, in coalescing,
have imparted it to the one planet constituted by their coalescence.—This
planet was Neptune. Its material continuing
to undergo condensation, and the centrifugal force
generated in its rotation getting, at length, the better of the
centripetal, as before in the case of the parent orb, a ring
was whirled also from the equatorial surface of this planet:
this ring, having been ununiform in its constitution, was
broken up, and its several fragments, being absorbed by the
most massive, were collectively spherified into a moon.
Subsequently, the operation was repeated, and a second
moon was the result. We thus account for the planet
Neptune, with the two satellites which accompany him.</p>

<p>In throwing off a ring from its equator, the Sun re-established
that equilibrium between its centripetal and
centrifugal forces which had been disturbed in the process
of condensation; but, as this condensation still proceeded,
the equilibrium was again immediately disturbed, through
the increase of rotation. By the time the mass had so far
shrunk that it occupied a spherical space just that circumscribed
by the orbit of Uranus, we are to understand that
the centrifugal force had so far obtained the ascendency
that new relief was needed: a second equatorial band was,
consequently, thrown off, which, proving ununiform, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
broken up, as before in the case of Neptune; the fragments
settling into the planet Uranus; the velocity of whose actual
revolution about the Sun indicates, of course, the rotary
speed of that Sun’s equatorial surface at the moment of the
separation. Uranus, adopting a rotation from the collective
rotations of the fragments composing it, as previously
explained, now threw off ring after ring; each of which,
becoming broken up, settled into a moon:—three moons,
at different epochs, having been formed, in this manner, by
the rupture and general spherification of as many distinct
ununiform rings.</p>

<p>By the time the Sun had shrunk until it occupied a
space just that circumscribed by the orbit of Saturn, the
balance, we are to suppose, between its centripetal and
centrifugal forces had again become so far disturbed, through
increase of rotary velocity, the result of condensation, that
a third effort at equilibrium became necessary; and an
annular band was therefore whirled off as twice before;
which, on rupture through ununiformity, became consolidated
into the planet Saturn. This latter threw off, in the
first place, seven uniform bands, which, on rupture, were
spherified respectively into as many moons; but, subsequently,
it appears to have discharged, at three distinct but
not very distant epochs, three rings whose equability of constitution
was, by apparent accident, so considerable as to
present no occasion for their rupture; thus they continue
to revolve as rings. I use the phrase “<i>apparent</i> accident;”
for of accident in the ordinary sense there was, of course,
nothing:—the term is properly applied only to the result
of indistinguishable or not immediately traceable <i>law</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Shrinking still farther, until it occupied just the space
circumscribed by the orbit of Jupiter, the Sun now found
need of farther effort to restore the counterbalance of its
two forces, continually disarranged in the still continued
increase of rotation. Jupiter, accordingly, was now thrown
off; passing from the annular to the planetary condition;
and, on attaining this latter, threw off in its turn, at four
different epochs, four rings, which finally resolved themselves
into so many moons.</p>

<p>Still shrinking, until its sphere occupied just the space
defined by the orbit of the Asteroids, the Sun now discarded
a ring which appears to have had <i>eight</i> centres of superior
solidity, and, on breaking up, to have separated into eight
fragments no one of which so far predominated in mass as
to absorb the others. All therefore, as distinct although
comparatively small planets, proceeded to revolve in orbits
whose distances, each from each, may be considered as in
some degree the measure of the force which drove them
asunder:—all the orbits, nevertheless, being so closely coincident
as to admit of our calling them <i>one</i>, in view of the
other planetary orbits.</p>

<p>Continuing to shrink, the Sun, on becoming so small as
just to fill the orbit of Mars, now discharged this planet—of
course by the process repeatedly described. Having no
moon, however, Mars could have thrown off no ring. In
fact, an epoch had now arrived in the career of the parent
body, the centre of the system. The <i>de</i>crease of its nebulosity,
which is the <i>in</i>crease of its density, and which again
is the <i>de</i>crease of its condensation, out of which latter arose
the constant disturbance of equilibrium—must, by this period,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
have attained a point at which the efforts for restoration
would have been more and more ineffectual just in
proportion as they were less frequently needed. Thus the
processes of which we have been speaking would everywhere
show signs of exhaustion—in the planets, first, and
secondly, in the original mass. We must not fall into the
error of supposing the decrease of interval observed among
the planets as we approach the Sun, to be in any respect
indicative of an increase of frequency in the periods at
which they were discarded. Exactly the converse is to be
understood. The longest interval of time must have occurred
between the discharges of the two interior; the
shortest, between those of the two exterior, planets. The
decrease of the interval of space is, nevertheless, the measure
of the density, and thus inversely of the condensation,
of the Sun, throughout the processes detailed.</p>

<p>Having shrunk, however, so far as to fill only the orbit
of our Earth, the parent sphere whirled from itself still one
other body—the Earth—in a condition so nebulous as to
admit of this body’s discarding, in its turn, yet another,
which is our Moon;—but here terminated the lunar formations.</p>

<p>Finally, subsiding to the orbits first of Venus and then of
Mercury, the Sun discarded these two interior planets;
neither of which has given birth to any moon.</p>

<p>Thus from his original bulk—or, to speak more accurately,
from the condition in which we first considered him—from
a partially spherified nebular mass, <i>certainly</i> much
more than 5,600 millions of miles in diameter—the great
central orb and origin of our solar-planetary-lunar system,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
has gradually descended, by condensation, in obedience to
the law of Gravity, to a globe only 882,000 miles in diameter;
but it by no means follows, either that its condensation
is yet complete, or that it may not still possess the capacity
of whirling from itself another planet.</p>

<p>I have here given—in outline of course, but still with
all the detail necessary for distinctness—a view of the Nebular
Theory as its author himself conceived it. From
whatever point we regard it, we shall find it <i>beautifully
true</i>. It is by far too beautiful, indeed, <i>not</i> to possess Truth
as its essentiality—and here I am very profoundly serious
in what I say. In the revolution of the satellites of Uranus,
there does appear something seemingly inconsistent with
the assumptions of Laplace; but that <i>one</i> inconsistency can
invalidate a theory constructed from a million of intricate
consistencies, is a fancy fit only for the fantastic. In prophecying,
confidently, that the apparent anomaly to which
I refer, will, sooner or later, be found one of the strongest
possible corroborations of the general hypothesis, I pretend
to no especial spirit of divination. It is a matter which the
only difficulty seems <i>not</i> to foresee.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The bodies whirled off in the processes described, would
exchange, it has been seen, the superficial <i>rotation</i> of the
orbs whence they originated, for a <i>revolution</i> of equal velocity
about these orbs as distant centres; and the revolution
thus engendered must proceed, so long as the centripetal
force, or that with which the discarded body gravitates toward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>its parent, is neither greater nor less than that by
which it was discarded; that is, than the centrifugal, or,
far more properly, than the tangential, velocity. From the
unity, however, of the origin of these two forces, we might
have expected to find them as they are found—the one
accurately counterbalancing the other. It has been shown,
indeed, that the act of whirling-off is, in every case, merely
an act for the preservation of the counterbalance.</p>

<p>After referring, however, the centripetal force to the
omniprevalent law of Gravity, it has been the fashion with
astronomical treatises, to seek beyond the limits of mere
Nature—that is to say, of <i>Secondary</i> Cause—a solution of
the phænomenon of tangential velocity. This latter they
attribute directly to a <i>First</i> Cause—to God. The force
which carries a stellar body around its primary they assert
to have originated in an impulse given immediately by the
finger—this is the childish phraseology employed—by the
finger of Deity itself. In this view, the planets, fully formed,
are conceived to have been hurled from the Divine hand,
to a position in the vicinity of the suns, with an impetus
mathematically adapted to the masses, or attractive capacities,
of the suns themselves. An idea so grossly unphilosophical,
although so supinely adopted, could have arisen
only from the difficulty of otherwise accounting for the
absolutely accurate adaptation, each to each, of two forces
so seemingly independent, one of the other, as are the gravitating
and tangential. But it should be remembered that,
for a long time, the coincidence between the moon’s rotation
and her sidereal revolution—two matters seemingly
far more independent than those now considered—was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
looked upon as positively miraculous; and there was a
strong disposition, even among astronomers, to attribute
the marvel to the direct and continual agency of God—who,
in this case, it was said, had found it necessary to interpose,
specially, among his general laws, a set of subsidiary
regulations, for the purpose of forever concealing from mortal
eyes the glories, or perhaps the horrors, of the other side
of the Moon—of that mysterious hemisphere which has always
avoided, and must perpetually avoid, the telescopic
scrutiny of mankind. The advance of Science, however,
soon demonstrated—what to the philosophical instinct
needed <i>no</i> demonstration—that the one movement is but a
portion—something more, even, than a consequence—of
the other.</p>

<p>For my part, I have no patience with fantasies at once
so timorous, so idle, and so awkward. They belong to
the veriest <i>cowardice</i> of thought. That Nature and the
God of Nature are distinct, no thinking being can long
doubt. By the former we imply merely the laws of the
latter. But with the very idea of God, omnipotent, omniscient,
we entertain, also, the idea of <i>the infallibility</i> of his
laws. With Him there being neither Past nor Future—with
Him all being <i>Now</i>—do we not insult him in supposing
his laws so contrived as not to provide for every possible
contingency?—or, rather, what idea <i>can</i> we have of <i>any</i>
possible contingency, except that it is at once a result and
a manifestation of his laws? He who, divesting himself of
prejudice, shall have the rare courage to think absolutely
for himself, cannot fail to arrive, in the end, at the condensation
of <i>laws</i> into <i>Law</i>—cannot fail of reaching the conclusion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that <i>each law of Nature is dependent at all points
upon all other laws</i>, and that all are but consequences of
one primary exercise of the Divine Volition. Such is the
principle of the Cosmogony which, with all necessary deference,
I here venture to suggest and to maintain.</p>

<p>In this view, it will be seen that, dismissing as frivolous,
and even impious, the fancy of the tangential force having
been imparted to the planets immediately by “the finger of
God,” I consider this force as originating in the rotation of
the stars:—this rotation as brought about by the in-rushing
of the primary atoms, towards their respective centres of
aggregation:—this in-rushing as the consequence of the law
of Gravity:—this law as but the mode in which is necessarily
manifested the tendency of the atoms to return into
imparticularity:—this tendency to return as but the inevitable
rëaction of the first and most sublime of Acts—that
act by which a God, self-existing and alone existing, became
all things at once, through dint of his volition, while
all things were thus constituted a portion of God.</p>

<p>The radical assumptions of this Discourse suggest to
me, and in fact imply, certain important <i>modifications</i> of
the Nebular Theory as given by Laplace. The efforts of
the repulsive power I have considered as made for the purpose
of preventing contact among the atoms, and thus as
made in the ratio of the approach to contact—that is to say,
in the ratio of condensation.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In other words, <i>Electricity</i>,
with its involute phænomena, heat, light and magnetism,
is to be understood as proceeding as condensation
proceeds, and, of course, inversely as density proceeds,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>or the <i>cessation to condense</i>. Thus the Sun, in the process
of its aggregation, must soon, in developing repulsion, have
become excessively heated—perhaps incandescent: and we
can perceive how the operation of discarding its rings must
have been materially assisted by the slight incrustation of
its surface consequent on cooling. Any common experiment
shows us how readily a crust of the character suggested,
is separated, through heterogeneity, from the interior
mass. But, on every successive rejection of the crust,
the new surface would appear incandescent as before; and
the period at which it would again become so far encrusted
as to be readily loosened and discharged, may well be imagined
as exactly coincident with that at which a new effort
would be needed, by the whole mass, to restore the equilibrium
of its two forces, disarranged through condensation.
In other words:—by the time the electric influence (Repulsion)
has prepared the surface for rejection, we are to
understand that the gravitating influence (Attraction) is
precisely ready to reject it. Here, then, as everywhere, <i>the
Body and the Soul walk hand in hand</i>.</p>

<p>These ideas are empirically confirmed at all points.
Since condensation can never, in any body, be considered
as absolutely at an end, we are warranted in anticipating
that, whenever we have an opportunity of testing the matter,
we shall find indications of resident luminosity in <i>all</i>
the stellar bodies—moons and planets as well as suns. That
our Moon is strongly self-luminous, we see at her every
total eclipse, when, if not so, she would disappear. On the
dark part of the satellite, too, during her phases, we often
observe flashes like our own Auroras; and that these latter,
with our various other so-called electrical phænomena,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
without reference to any more steady radiance, must give
our Earth a certain appearance of luminosity to an inhabitant
of the Moon, is quite evident. In fact, we should regard
all the phænomena referred to, as mere manifestations, in
different moods and degrees, of the Earth’s feebly-continued
condensation.</p>

<p>If my views are tenable, we should be prepared to find
the newer planets—that is to say, those nearer the Sun—more
luminous than those older and more remote:—and
the extreme brilliancy of Venus (on whose dark portions,
during her phases, the Auroras are frequently visible) does
not seem to be altogether accounted for by her mere proximity
to the central orb. She is no doubt vividly self-luminous,
although less so than Mercury: while the luminosity
of Neptune may be comparatively nothing.</p>

<p>Admitting what I have urged, it is clear that, from the
moment of the Sun’s discarding a ring, there must be a
continuous diminution both of his heat and light, on account
of the continuous encrustation of his surface; and that a
period would arrive—the period immediately previous to a
new discharge—when a <i>very material</i> decrease of both
light and heat, must become apparent. Now, we know
that tokens of such changes are distinctly recognizable.
On the Melville islands—to adduce merely one out of a
hundred examples—we find traces of <i>ultra-tropical</i> vegetation—of
plants that never could have flourished without
immensely more light and heat than are at present afforded
by our Sun to any portion of the surface of the Earth. Is
such vegetation referable to an epoch immediately subsequent
to the whirling-off of Venus? At this epoch must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
have occurred to us our greatest access of solar influence;
and, in fact, this influence must then have attained its maximum:—leaving
out of view, of course, the period when the
Earth itself was discarded—the period of its mere organization.</p>

<p>Again:—we know that there exist <i>non-luminous suns</i>—that
is to say, suns whose existence we determine through
the movements of others, but whose luminosity is not sufficient
to impress us. Are these suns invisible merely on
account of the length of time elapsed since their discharge
of a planet? And yet again:—may we not—at least in
certain cases—account for the sudden appearances of suns
where none had been previously suspected, by the hypothesis
that, having rolled with encrusted surfaces throughout
the few thousand years of our astronomical history,
each of these suns, in whirling off a new secondary, has at
length been enabled to display the glories of its still incandescent
interior?—To the well-ascertained fact of the proportional
increase of heat as we descend into the Earth, I
need of course, do nothing more than refer:—it comes in
the strongest possible corroboration of all that I have said
on the topic now at issue.</p>

<p>In speaking, not long ago, of the repulsive or electrical
influence, I remarked that “the important phænomena of
vitality, consciousness, and thought, whether we observe
them generally or in detail, seem to proceed <i>at least in the
ratio of the heterogeneous</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> I mentioned, too, that I would
recur to the suggestion:—and this is the proper point at
which to do so. Looking at the matter, first, in detail, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>perceive that not merely the <i>manifestation</i> of vitality, but
its importance, consequence, and elevation of character,
keep pace, very closely, with the heterogeneity, or complexity,
of the animal structure. Looking at the question,
now, in its generality, and referring to the first movements
of the atoms towards mass-constitution, we find that heterogeneousness,
brought about directly through condensation,
is proportional with it forever. We thus reach the
proposition that <i>the importance of the development of the
terrestrial vitality proceeds equably with the terrestrial condensation</i>.</p>

<p>Now this is in precise accordance with what we know
of the succession of animals on the Earth. As it has proceeded
in its condensation, superior and still superior races
have appeared. Is it impossible that the successive geological
revolutions which have attended, at least, if not immediately
caused, these successive elevations of vitalic
character—is it improbable that these revolutions have
themselves been produced by the successive planetary discharges
from the Sun—in other words, by the successive
variations in the solar influence on the Earth? Were this
idea tenable, we should not be unwarranted in the fancy
that the discharge of yet a new planet, interior to Mercury,
may give rise to yet a new modification of the terrestrial
surface—a modification from which may spring a
race both materially and spiritually superior to Man. These
thoughts impress me with all the force of truth—but I throw
them out, of course, merely in their obvious character of
suggestion.</p>

<p>The Nebular Theory of Laplace has lately received far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
more confirmation than it needed, at the hands of the philosopher,
Compte. These two have thus together shown—<i>not</i>,
to be sure, that Matter at any period actually existed
as described, in a state of nebular diffusion, but that, admitting
it so to have existed throughout the space and much
beyond the space now occupied by our solar system, <i>and to
have commenced a movement towards a centre</i>—it must
gradually have assumed the various forms and motions
which are now seen, in that system, to obtain. A demonstration
such as this—a dynamical and mathematical demonstration,
as far as demonstration can be—unquestionable
and unquestioned—unless, indeed, by that unprofitable and
disreputable tribe, the professional questioners—the mere
madmen who deny the Newtonian law of Gravity on
which the results of the French mathematicians are based—a
demonstration, I say, such as this, would to most intellects
be conclusive—and I confess that it is so to mine—of
the validity of the nebular hypothesis upon which the demonstration
depends.</p>

<p>That the demonstration does not <i>prove</i> the hypothesis,
according to the common understanding of the word
“proof,” I admit, of course. To show that certain existing
results—that certain established facts—may be, even mathematically,
accounted for by the assumption of a certain hypothesis,
is by no means to establish the hypothesis itself.
In other words:—to show that, certain data being given, a
certain existing result might, or even <i>must</i>, have ensued,
will fail to prove that this result <i>did</i> ensue, <i>from the data</i>,
until such time as it shall be also shown that there are, <i>and
can be</i>, no other data from which the result in question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
might <i>equally</i> have ensued. But, in the case now discussed,
although all must admit the deficiency of what we
are in the habit of terming “proof,” still there are many
intellects, and those of the loftiest order, to which <i>no</i> proof
could bring one iota of additional <i>conviction</i>. Without
going into details which might impinge upon the Cloud-Land
of Metaphysics, I may as well here observe that the force
of conviction, in cases such as this, will always, with the
right-thinking, be proportional to the amount of <i>complexity</i>
intervening between the hypothesis and the result. To be
less abstract:—The greatness of the complexity found existing
among cosmical conditions, by rendering great in
the same proportion the difficulty of accounting for all
these conditions <i>at once</i>, strengthens, also in the same proportion,
our faith in that hypothesis which does, in such
manner, satisfactorily account for them:—and as <i>no</i> complexity
can well be conceived greater than that of the astronomical
conditions, so no conviction can be stronger—to
<i>my</i> mind at least—than that with which I am impressed
by an hypothesis that not only reconciles these conditions,
with mathematical accuracy, and reduces them into a consistent
and intelligible whole, but is, at the same time, the
<i>sole</i> hypothesis by means of which the human intellect has
been ever enabled to account for them <i>at all</i>.</p>

<p>A most unfounded opinion has become latterly current
in gossiping and even in scientific circles—the opinion that
the so-called Nebular Cosmogony has been overthrown.
This fancy has arisen from the report of late observations
made, among what hitherto have been termed the “nebulæ,”
through the large telescope of Cincinnati, and the world-renowned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
instrument of Lord Rosse. Certain spots in the
firmament which presented, even to the most powerful of
the old telescopes, the appearance of nebulosity, or haze,
had been regarded for a long time as confirming the theory
of Laplace. They were looked upon as stars in that very
process of condensation which I have been attempting to
describe. Thus it was supposed that we “had ocular evidence”—an
evidence, by the way, which has always been
found very questionable—of the truth of the hypothesis;
and, although certain telescopic improvements, every now
and then, enabled us to perceive that a spot, here and there,
which we had been classing among the nebulæ, was, in fact,
but a cluster of stars deriving its nebular character only
from its immensity of distance—still it was thought that no
doubt could exist as to the actual nebulosity of numerous
other masses, the strong-holds of the nebulists, bidding defiance
to every effort at segregation. Of these latter the
most interesting was the great “nebulæ” in the constellation
Orion:—but this, with innumerable other mis-called
“nebulæ,” when viewed through the magnificent modern
telescopes, has become resolved into a simple collection of
stars. Now this fact has been very generally understood
as conclusive against the Nebular Hypothesis of Laplace;
and, on announcement of the discoveries in question, the
most enthusiastic defender and most eloquent popularizer of
the theory, Dr. Nichol, went so far as to “admit the necessity
of abandoning” an idea which had formed the material
of his most praiseworthy book.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<p>Many of my readers will no doubt be inclined to say
that the result of these new investigations <i>has</i> at least a
strong <i>tendency</i> to overthrow the hypothesis; while some
of them, more thoughtful, will suggest that, although the
theory is by no means disproved through the segregation of
the particular “nebulæ,” alluded to, still a <i>failure</i> to segregate
them, with such telescopes, might well have been understood
as a triumphant <i>corroboration</i> of the theory:—and
this latter class will be surprised, perhaps, to hear me say
that even with <i>them</i> I disagree. If the propositions of this
Discourse have been comprehended, it will be seen that, in
my view, a failure to segregate the “nebulæ” would have
tended to the refutation, rather than to the confirmation, of
the Nebular Hypothesis.</p>

<p>Let me explain:—The Newtonian Law of Gravity we
may, of course, assume as demonstrated. This law, it will
be remembered, I have referred to the rëaction of the first
Divine Act—to the rëaction of an exercise of the Divine
Volition temporarily overcoming a difficulty. This difficulty
is that of forcing the normal into the abnormal—of
impelling that whose originality, and therefore whose rightful
condition, was <i>One</i>, to take upon itself the wrongful condition
of <i>Many</i>. It is only by conceiving this difficulty as
<i>temporarily</i> overcome, that we can comprehend a rëaction.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>There could have been no rëaction had the act been infinitely
continued. So long as the act <i>lasted</i>, no rëaction, of
course, could commence; in other words, no <i>gravitation</i>
could take place—for we have considered the one as but
the manifestation of the other. But gravitation <i>has</i> taken
place; therefore the act of Creation has ceased: and gravitation
has long ago taken place; therefore the act of Creation
has long ago ceased. We can no more expect, then,
to observe <i>the primary processes</i> of Creation; and to these
primary processes the condition of nebulosity has already
been explained to belong.</p>

<p>Through what we know of the propagation of light, we
have direct proof that the more remote of the stars have
existed, under the forms in which we now see them, for an
inconceivable number of years. So far back <i>at least</i>, then,
as the period when these stars underwent condensation,
must have been the epoch at which the mass-constitutive
processes began. That we may conceive these processes,
then, as still going on in the case of certain “nebulæ,”
while in all other cases we find them thoroughly at an end,
we are forced into assumptions for which we have really
<i>no</i> basis whatever—we have to thrust in, again, upon the revolting
Reason, the blasphemous idea of special interposition—we
have to suppose that, in the particular instances of these
“nebulæ,” an unerring God found it necessary to introduce
certain supplementary regulations—certain improvements
of the general law—certain retouchings and emendations,
in a word, which had the effect of deferring the completion
of these individual stars for centuries of centuries beyond
the æra during which all the other stellar bodies had time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
not only to be fully constituted, but to grow hoary with an
unspeakable old age.</p>

<p>Of course, it will be immediately objected that since the
light by which we recognize the nebulæ now, must be
merely that which left their surfaces a vast number of years
ago, the processes at present observed, or supposed to be
observed, are, in fact, <i>not</i> processes now actually going on,
but the phantoms of processes completed long in the Past—just
as I maintain all these mass-constitutive processes
<i>must</i> have been.</p>

<p>To this I reply that neither is the now-observed condition
of the condensed stars their actual condition, but a
condition completed long in the Past; so that my argument
drawn from the <i>relative</i> condition of the stars and the
“nebulæ,” is in no manner disturbed. Moreover, those
who maintain the existence of nebulæ, do <i>not</i> refer the
nebulosity to extreme distance; they declare it a real and
not merely a perspective nebulosity. That we may conceive,
indeed, a nebular mass as visible at all, we must conceive
it as <i>very near us</i> in comparison with the condensed
stars brought into view by the modern telescopes. In
maintaining the appearances in question, then, to be really
nebulous, we maintain their comparative vicinity to our
point of view. Thus, their condition, as we see them now,
must be referred to an epoch <i>far less remote</i> than that to
which we may refer the now-observed condition of at least
the majority of the stars.—In a word, should Astronomy
ever demonstrate a “nebula,” in the sense at present intended,
I should consider the Nebular Cosmogony—<i>not</i>, indeed,
as corroborated by the demonstration—but as thereby
irretrievably overthrown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>By way, however, of rendering unto Cæsar <i>no more</i>
than the things that are Cæsar’s, let me here remark that
the assumption of the hypothesis which led him to so glorious
a result, seems to have been suggested to Laplace in
great measure by a misconception—by the very misconception
of which we have just been speaking—by the generally
prevalent misunderstanding of the character of the
nebulæ, so mis-named. These he supposed to be, in reality,
what their designation implies. The fact is, this great man
had, very properly, an inferior faith in his own merely <i>perceptive</i>
powers. In respect, therefore, to the actual existence
of nebulæ—an existence so confidently maintained by
his telescopic contemporaries—he depended less upon what
he saw than upon what he heard.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the only valid objections to his
theory, are those made to its hypothesis <i>as</i> such—to what
suggested it—not to what it suggests; to its propositions
rather than to its results. His most unwarranted assumption
was that of giving the atoms a movement towards a
centre, in the very face of his evident understanding that
these atoms, in unlimited succession, extended throughout
the Universal space. I have already shown that, under
such circumstances, there could have occurred no movement
at all; and Laplace, consequently, assumed one on
no more philosophical ground than that something of the
kind was necessary for the establishment of what he intended
to establish.</p>

<p>His original idea seems to have been a compound of
the true Epicurean atoms with the false nebulæ of his contemporaries;
and thus his theory presents us with the singular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
anomaly of absolute truth deduced, as a mathematical
result, from a hybrid datum of ancient imagination intertangled
with modern inacumen. Laplace’s real strength
lay, in fact, in an almost miraculous mathematical instinct:—on
this he relied; and in no instance did it fail or deceive
him:—in the case of the Nebular Cosmogony, it led him,
blindfolded, through a labyrinth of Error, into one of the
most luminous and stupendous temples of Truth.</p>

<p>Let us now fancy, for the moment, that the ring first
thrown off by the Sun—that is to say, the ring whose
breaking-up constituted Neptune—did not, in fact, break
up until the throwing-off of the ring out of which Uranus
arose; that this latter ring, again, remained perfect until
the discharge of that out of which sprang Saturn; that this
latter, again, remained entire until the discharge of that
from which originated Jupiter—and so on. Let us imagine,
in a word, that no dissolution occurred among the rings
until the final rejection of that which gave birth to Mercury.
We thus paint to the eye of the mind a series of
cöexistent concentric circles; and looking as well at <i>them</i>
as at the processes by which, according to Laplace’s hypothesis,
they were constructed, we perceive at once a very
singular analogy with the atomic strata and the process of
the original irradiation as I have described it. Is it impossible
that, on measuring the <i>forces</i>, respectively, by which
each successive planetary circle was thrown off—that is to
say, on measuring the successive excesses of rotation over
gravitation which occasioned the successive discharges—we
should find the analogy in question more decidedly confirmed?
<i>Is it improbable that we should discover these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
forces to have varied—as in the original radiation—proportionally
to the squares of the distances?</i></p>

<p>Our solar system, consisting, in chief, of one sun, with
sixteen planets certainly, and possibly a few more, revolving
about it at various distances, and attended by seventeen
moons assuredly, but <i>very</i> probably by several others—is
now to be considered as <i>an example</i> of the innumerable
agglomerations which proceeded to take place throughout
the Universal Sphere of atoms on withdrawal of the Divine
Volition. I mean to say that our solar system is to be understood
as affording a <i>generic instance</i> of these agglomerations,
or, more correctly, of the ulterior conditions at which
they arrived. If we keep our attention fixed on the idea
of <i>the utmost possible Relation</i> as the Omnipotent design,
and on the precautions taken to accomplish it through difference
of form, among the original atoms, and particular
inequidistance, we shall find it impossible to suppose for a
moment that even any two of the incipient agglomerations
reached precisely the same result in the end. We shall
rather be inclined to think that <i>no two</i> stellar bodies in the
Universe—whether suns, planets or moons—are particularly,
while <i>all</i> are generally, similar. Still less, then, can
we imagine any two <i>assemblages</i> of such bodies—any two
“systems”—as having more than a general resemblance.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Our telescopes, at this point, thoroughly confirm our deductions.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>Taking our own solar system, then, as merely a
loose or general type of all, we have so far proceeded in
our subject as to survey the Universe under the aspect of a
spherical space, throughout which, dispersed with merely
general equability, exist a number of but generally similar
<i>systems</i>.</p>

<p>Let us now, expanding our conceptions, look upon each
of these systems as in itself an atom; which in fact it is,
when we consider it as but one of the countless myriads of
systems which constitute the Universe. Regarding all,
then, as but colossal atoms, each with the same ineradicable
tendency to Unity which characterizes the actual atoms of
which it consists—we enter at once upon a new order of
aggregations. The smaller systems, in the vicinity of a
larger one, would, inevitably, be drawn into still closer
vicinity. A thousand would assemble here; a million there—perhaps
here, again, even a billion—leaving, thus, immeasurable
vacancies in space. And if now, it be demanded
why, in the case of these systems—of these merely Titanic
atoms—I speak, simply, of an “assemblage,” and not, as in
the case of the actual atoms, of a more or less consolidated
agglomeration:—if it be asked, for instance, why I do not
carry what I suggest to its legitimate conclusion, and describe,
at once, these assemblages of system-atoms as rushing
to consolidation in spheres—as each becoming condensed
into one magnificent sun—my reply is that μελλοντα ταυτα—I
am but pausing, for a moment, on the awful threshold of
<i>the Future</i>. For the present, calling these assemblages
“clusters,” we see them in the incipient stages of their
consolidation. Their <i>absolute</i> consolidation is <i>to come</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>We have now reached a point from which we behold
the Universe as a spherical space, interspersed, <i>unequably</i>,
with <i>clusters</i>. It will be noticed that I here prefer the adverb
“unequably” to the phrase “with a merely general
equability,” employed before. It is evident, in fact, that
the equability of distribution will diminish in the ratio of
the agglomerative processes—that is to say, as the things
distributed diminish in number. Thus the increase of <i>in</i>-equability—an
increase which must continue until, sooner
or later, an epoch will arrive at which the largest agglomeration
will absorb all the others—should be viewed as,
simply, a corroborative indication of the <i>tendency to One</i>.</p>

<p>And here, at length, it seems proper to inquire whether
the ascertained <i>facts</i> of Astronomy confirm the general
arrangement which I have thus, deductively, assigned to
the Heavens. Thoroughly, they <i>do</i>. Telescopic observation,
guided by the laws of perspective, enables us to understand
that the perceptible Universe exists as <i>a cluster of
clusters, irregularly disposed</i>.</p>

<p>The “clusters” of which this Universal “<i>cluster of
clusters</i>” consists, are merely what we have been in the
practice of designating “nebulæ”—and, of these “nebulæ,”
<i>one</i> is of paramount interest to mankind. I allude to the
Galaxy, or Milky Way. This interests us, first and most
obviously, on account of its great superiority in apparent
size, not only to any one other cluster in the firmament, but
to all the other clusters taken together. The largest of
these latter occupies a mere point, comparatively, and is
distinctly seen only with the aid of a telescope. The Galaxy
sweeps throughout the Heaven and is brilliantly visible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to the naked eye. But it interests man chiefly, although
less immediately, on account of its being his home; the
home of the Earth on which he exists; the home of the
Sun about which this Earth revolves; the home of that
“system” of orbs of which the Sun is the centre and primary—the
Earth one of sixteen secondaries, or planets—the
Moon one of seventeen tertiaries, or satellites. The
Galaxy, let me repeat, is but one of the <i>clusters</i> which I
have been describing—but one of the mis-called “nebulæ”
revealed to us—by the telescope alone, sometimes—as faint
hazy spots in various quarters of the sky. We have no
reason to suppose the Milky Way <i>really</i> more extensive
than the least of these “nebulæ.” Its vast superiority in
size is but an apparent superiority arising from our position
in regard to it—that is to say, from our position in its midst.
However strange the assertion may at first appear to those
unversed in Astronomy, still the astronomer himself has no
hesitation in asserting that we are <i>in the midst</i> of that inconceivable
host of stars—of suns—of systems—which constitute
the Galaxy. Moreover, not only have <i>we</i>—not only
has <i>our</i> Sun a right to claim the Galaxy as its own especial
cluster, but, with slight reservation, it may be said that all
the distinctly visible stars of the firmament—all the stars
Visible to the naked eye—have equally a right to claim it
as <i>their</i> own.</p>

<p>There has been a great deal of misconception in respect
to the <i>shape</i> of the Galaxy; which, in nearly all our astronomical
treatises, is said to resemble that of a capital Y.
The cluster in question has, in reality, a certain general—<i>very</i>
general resemblance to the planet Saturn, with its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
encompassing triple ring. Instead of the solid orb of that
planet, however, we must picture to ourselves a lenticular
star-island, or collection of stars; our Sun lying excentrically—near
the shore of the island—on that side of it which
is nearest the constellation of the Cross and farthest from
that of Cassiopeia. The surrounding ring, where it approaches
our position, has in it a longitudinal <i>gash</i>, which
does, in fact, cause <i>the ring, in our vicinity</i>, to assume,
loosely, the appearance of a capital Y.</p>

<p>We must not fall into the error, however, of conceiving
the somewhat indefinite girdle as at all <i>remote</i>, comparatively
speaking, from the also indefinite lenticular cluster
which it surrounds; and thus, for mere purpose of explanation,
we may speak of our Sun as actually situated at
that point of the Y where its three component lines unite;
and, conceiving this letter to be of a certain solidity—of a
certain thickness, very trivial in comparison with its length—we
may even speak of our position as <i>in the middle</i> of
this thickness. Fancying ourselves thus placed, we shall
no longer find difficulty in accounting for the phænomena
presented—which are perspective altogether. When we
look upward or downward—that is to say, when we cast
our eyes in the direction of the letter’s <i>thickness</i>—we look
through fewer stars than when we cast them in the direction
of its <i>length</i>, or <i>along</i> either of the three component lines.
Of course, in the former case, the stars appear scattered—in
the latter, crowded.—To reverse this explanation:—An
inhabitant of the Earth, when looking, as we commonly express
ourselves, <i>at</i> the Galaxy, is then beholding it in some
of the directions of its length—is looking <i>along</i> the lines of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the Y—but when, looking out into the general Heaven, he
turns his eyes <i>from</i> the Galaxy, he is then surveying it in
the direction of the letter’s thickness; and on this account
the stars seem to him scattered; while, in fact, they are as
close together, on an average, as in the mass of the cluster.
<i>No</i> consideration could be better adapted to convey an idea
of this cluster’s stupendous extent.</p>

<p>If, with a telescope of high space-penetrating power, we
carefully inspect the firmament, we shall become aware of
<i>a belt of clusters</i>—of what we have hitherto called “nebulæ”—a
<i>band</i>, of varying breadth, stretching from horizon
to horizon, at right angles to the general course of the Milky
Way. This band is the ultimate <i>cluster of clusters</i>. This
belt is <i>The Universe</i>. Our Galaxy is but one, and perhaps
one of the most inconsiderable, of the clusters which go to
the constitution of this ultimate, Universal <i>belt</i> or <i>band</i>.
The appearance of this cluster of clusters, to our eyes, <i>as</i> a
belt or band, is altogether a perspective phænomenon of the
same character as that which causes us to behold our own
individual and roughly-spherical cluster, the Galaxy, under
guise also of a belt, traversing the Heavens at right angles
to the Universal one. The shape of the all-inclusive cluster
is, of course <i>generally</i>, that of each individual cluster
which it includes. Just as the scattered stars which, on
looking <i>from</i> the Galaxy, we see in the general sky, are, in
fact, but a portion of that Galaxy itself, and as closely intermingled
with it as any of the telescopic points in what
seems the densest portion of its mass—so are the scattered
“nebulæ” which, on casting our eyes <i>from</i> the Universal
<i>belt</i>, we perceive at all points of the firmament—so, I say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
are these scattered “nebulæ” to be understood as only
perspectively scattered, and as part and parcel of the one
supreme and Universal <i>sphere</i>.</p>

<p>No astronomical fallacy is more untenable, and none
has been more pertinaciously adhered to, than that of the
absolute <i>illimitation</i> of the Universe of Stars. The reasons
for limitation, as I have already assigned them, <i>à priori</i>,
seem to me unanswerable; but, not to speak of these, <i>observation</i>
assures us that there is, in numerous directions around
us, certainly, if not in all, a positive limit—or, at the very
least, affords us no basis whatever for thinking otherwise.
Were the succession of stars endless, then the background
of the sky would present us an uniform luminosity, like that
displayed by the Galaxy—<i>since there could be absolutely no
point, in all that background, at which would not exist a
star.</i> The only mode, therefore, in which, under such a
state of affairs, we could comprehend the <i>voids</i> which our
telescopes find in innumerable directions, would be by supposing
the distance of the invisible background so immense
that no ray from it has yet been able to reach us at all.
That this <i>may</i> be so, who shall venture to deny? I maintain,
simply, that we have not even the shadow of a reason
for believing that it <i>is</i> so.</p>

<p>When speaking of the vulgar propensity to regard all
bodies on the Earth as tending merely to the Earth’s centre,
I observed that, “with certain exceptions to be specified
hereafter, every body on the Earth tended not only to the
Earth’s centre, but in every conceivable direction besides.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
The “exceptions” refer to those frequent gaps in the Heavens,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>where our utmost scrutiny can detect not only no
stellar bodies, but no indications of their existence:—where
yawning chasms, blacker than Erebus, seem to afford us
glimpses, through the boundary walls of the Universe of
Stars, into the illimitable Universe of Vacancy, beyond.
Now as any body, existing on the Earth, chances to pass,
either through its own movement or the Earth’s, into a line
with any one of these voids, or cosmical abysses, it clearly
is no longer attracted <i>in the direction of that void</i>, and
for the moment, consequently, is “heavier” than at any
period, either after or before. Independently of the consideration
of these voids, however, and looking only at the
generally unequable distribution of the stars, we see that
the absolute tendency of bodies on the Earth to the Earth’s
centre, is in a state of perpetual variation.</p>

<p>We comprehend, then, the insulation of our Universe.
We perceive the isolation of <i>that</i>—of <i>all</i> that which we
grasp with the senses. We know that there exists one
<i>cluster of clusters</i>—a collection around which, on all sides,
extend the immeasurable wildernesses of a Space <i>to all human
perception</i> untenanted. But <i>because</i> upon the confines
of this Universe of Stars we are compelled to pause, through
want of farther evidence from the senses, is it right to conclude
that, in fact, there <i>is</i> no material point beyond that
which we have thus been permitted to attain? Have we,
or have we not, an analogical right to the inference that
this perceptible Universe—that this cluster of clusters—is
but one of <i>a series</i> of clusters of clusters, the rest of which
are invisible through distance—through the diffusion of their
light being so excessive, ere it reaches us, as not to produce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
upon our retinas a light-impression—or from there being no
such emanation as light at all, in these unspeakably distant
worlds—or, lastly, from the mere interval being so vast, that
the electric tidings of their presence in Space, have not yet—through
the lapsing myriads of years—been enabled to
traverse that interval?</p>

<p>Have we any right to inferences—have we any ground
whatever for visions such as these? If we have a right to
them in <i>any</i> degree, we have a right to their infinite extension.</p>

<p>The human brain has obviously a leaning to the “<i>Infinite</i>,”
and fondles the phantom of the idea. It seems to
long with a passionate fervor for this impossible conception,
with the hope of intellectually believing it when conceived.
What is general among the whole race of Man, of course
no individual of that race can be warranted in considering
abnormal; nevertheless, there <i>may</i> be a class of superior
intelligences, to whom the human bias alluded to may wear
all the character of monomania.</p>

<p>My question, however, remains unanswered:—Have we
any right to infer—let us say, rather, to imagine—an interminable
succession of the “clusters of clusters,” or of “Universes”
more or less similar?</p>

<p>I reply that the “right,” in a case such as this, depends
absolutely upon the hardihood of that imagination which
ventures to claim the right. Let me declare, only, that, as
an individual, I myself feel impelled to the <i>fancy</i>—without
daring to call it more—that there <i>does</i> exist a <i>limitless</i> succession
of Universes, more or less similar to that of which
we have cognizance—to that of which <i>alone</i> we shall ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
have cognizance—at the very least until the return of our
own particular Universe into Unity. <i>If</i> such clusters of
clusters exist, however—<i>and they do</i>—it is abundantly clear
that, having had no part in our origin, they have no portion
in our laws. They neither attract us, nor we them. Their
material—their spirit is not ours—is not that which obtains
in any part of our Universe. They could not impress our
senses or our souls. Among them and us—considering all,
for the moment, collectively—there are no influences in
common. Each exists, apart and independently, <i>in the bosom
of its proper and particular God</i>.</p>

<p>In the conduct of this Discourse, I am aiming less at
physical than at metaphysical order. The clearness with
which even material phænomena are presented to the understanding,
depends very little, I have long since learned to
perceive, upon a merely natural, and almost altogether upon
a moral, arrangement. If then I seem to step somewhat too
discursively from point to point of my topic, let me suggest
that I do so in the hope of thus the better keeping unbroken
that chain of <i>graduated impression</i> by which alone the intellect
of Man can expect to encompass the grandeurs of
which I speak, and, in their majestic totality, to comprehend
them.</p>

<p>So far, our attention has been directed, almost exclusively,
to a general and relative grouping of the stellar
bodies in space. Of specification there has been little;
and whatever ideas of <i>quantity</i> have been conveyed—that
is to say, of number, magnitude, and distance—have been
conveyed incidentally and by way of preparation for more
definitive conceptions. These latter let us now attempt to
entertain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Our solar system, as has been already mentioned, consists,
in chief, of one sun and sixteen planets certainly, but
in all probability a few others, revolving around it as a
centre, and attended by seventeen moons of which we
know, with possibly several more of which as yet we know
nothing. These various bodies are not true spheres, but
oblate spheroids—spheres flattened at the poles of the imaginary
axes about which they rotate:—the flattening being
a consequence of the rotation. Neither is the Sun absolutely
the centre of the system; for this Sun itself, with all
the planets, revolves about a perpetually shifting point of
space, which is the system’s general centre of gravity.
Neither are we to consider the paths through which these
different spheroids move—the moons about the planets, the
planets about the Sun, or the Sun about the common centre—as
circles in an accurate sense. They are, in fact,
<i>ellipses—one of the foci being the point about which the
revolution is made</i>. An ellipse is a curve, returning into
itself, one of whose diameters is longer than the other. In
the longer diameter are two points, equidistant from the
middle of the line, and so situated otherwise that if, from
each of them a straight line be drawn to any one point of
the curve, the two lines, taken together, will be equal to the
longer diameter itself. Now let us conceive such an ellipse.
At one of the points mentioned, which are the <i>foci</i>, let us
fasten an orange. By an elastic thread let us connect this
orange with a pea; and let us place this latter on the circumference
of the ellipse. Let us now move the pea continuously
around the orange—keeping always on the circumference
of the ellipse. The elastic thread, which, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
course, varies in length as we move the pea, will form what
in geometry is called a <i>radius vector</i>. Now, if the orange
be understood as the Sun, and the pea as a planet revolving
about it, then the revolution should be made at such a rate—with
a velocity so varying—that the <i>radius vector</i> may
pass over <i>equal areas of space in equal times</i>. The progress
of the pea <i>should be</i>—in other words, the progress of
the planet <i>is</i>, of course,—slow in proportion to its distance
from the Sun—swift in proportion to its proximity. Those
planets, moreover, move the more slowly which are the
farther from the Sun; <i>the squares of their periods of revolution
having the same proportion to each other, as have
to each other the cubes of their mean distances from the
Sun</i>.</p>

<p>The wonderfully complex laws of revolution here described,
however, are not to be understood as obtaining in
our system alone. They <i>everywhere</i> prevail where Attraction
prevails. They control <i>the Universe</i>. Every shining
speck in the firmament is, no doubt, a luminous sun, resembling
our own, at least in its general features, and having in
attendance upon it a greater or less number of planets,
greater or less, whose still lingering luminosity is not sufficient
to render them visible to us at so vast a distance, but
which, nevertheless, revolve, moon-attended, about their
starry centres, in obedience to the principles just detailed—in
obedience to the three omniprevalent laws of revolution—the
three immortal laws <i>guessed</i> by the imaginative Kepler,
and but subsequently demonstrated and accounted for
by the patient and mathematical Newton. Among a tribe
of philosophers who pride themselves excessively upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
matter-of-fact, it is far too fashionable to sneer at all speculation
under the comprehensive <i>sobriquet</i>, “guess-work.”
The point to be considered is, <i>who</i> guesses. In guessing
with Plato, we spend our time to better purpose, now
and then, than in hearkening to a demonstration by
Alcmæon.</p>

<p>In many works on Astronomy I find it distinctly stated
that the laws of Kepler are <i>the basis</i> of the great principle,
Gravitation. This idea must have arisen from the fact that
the suggestion of these laws by Kepler, and his proving
them <i>à posteriori</i> to have an actual existence, led Newton
to account for them by the hypothesis of Gravitation, and,
finally, to demonstrate them <i>à priori</i>, as necessary consequences
of the hypothetical principle. Thus so far from the
laws of Kepler being the basis of Gravity, Gravity is the
basis of these laws—as it is, indeed, of all the laws of the
material Universe which are not referable to Repulsion
alone.</p>

<p>The mean distance of the Earth from the Moon—that
is to say, from the heavenly body in our closest vicinity—is
237,000 miles. Mercury, the planet nearest the Sun, is
distant from him 37 millions of miles. Venus, the next,
revolves at a distance of 68 millions:—the Earth, which
comes next, at a distance of 95 millions:—Mars, then, at a
distance of 144 millions. Now come the eight Asteroids
(Ceres, Juno, Vesta, Pallas, Astræa, Flora, Iris, and Hebe)
at an average distance of about 250 millions. Then we
have Jupiter, distant 490 millions; then Saturn, 900 millions;
then Uranus, 19 hundred millions; finally Neptune,
lately discovered, and revolving at a distance, say of 28<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
hundred millions. Leaving Neptune out of the account—of
which as yet we know little accurately and which is,
possibly, one of a system of Asteroids—it will be seen that,
within certain limits, there exists an <i>order of interval</i>
among the planets. Speaking loosely, we may say that
each outer planet is twice as far from the Sun as is the
next inner one. May not the <i>order</i> here mentioned—<i>may
not the law of Bode—be deduced from consideration of
the analogy suggested by me as having place between the
solar discharge of rings and the mode of the atomic irradiation</i>?</p>

<p>The numbers hurriedly mentioned in this summary of
distance, it is folly to attempt comprehending, unless in the
light of abstract arithmetical facts. They are not practically
tangible ones. They convey no precise ideas. I
have stated that Neptune, the planet farthest from the Sun,
revolves about him at a distance of 28 hundred millions of
miles. So far good:—I have stated a mathematical fact;
and, without comprehending it in the least, we may put it
to use—mathematically. But in mentioning, even, that
the Moon revolves about the Earth at the comparatively
trifling distance of 237,000 miles, I entertained no expectation
of giving any one to understand—to know—to feel—how
far from the Earth the Moon actually <i>is</i>. 237,000
<i>miles</i>! There are, perhaps, few of my readers who have
not crossed the Atlantic ocean; yet how many of them
have a distinct idea of even the 3,000 miles intervening
between shore and shore? I doubt, indeed, whether the
man lives who can force into his brain the most remote conception
of the interval between one milestone and its next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
neighbor upon the turnpike. We are in some measure
aided, however, in our consideration of distance, by combining
this consideration with the kindred one of velocity.
Sound passes through 1100 feet of space in a second of
time. Now were it possible for an inhabitant of the Earth
to see the flash of a cannon discharged in the Moon, and
to hear the report, he would have to wait, after perceiving
the former, more than 13 entire days and nights before
getting any intimation of the latter.</p>

<p>However feeble be the impression, even thus conveyed,
of the Moon’s real distance from the Earth, it will, nevertheless,
effect a good object in enabling us more clearly to
see the futility of attempting to grasp such intervals as that
of the 28 hundred millions of miles between our Sun and
Neptune; or even that of the 95 millions between the Sun
and the Earth we inhabit. A cannon-ball, flying at the
greatest velocity with which such a ball has ever been
known to fly, could not traverse the latter interval in
less than 20 years; while for the former it would require
590.</p>

<p>Our Moon’s real diameter is 2160 miles; yet she is
comparatively so trifling an object that it would take nearly
50 such orbs to compose one as great as the Earth.</p>

<p>The diameter of our own globe is 7912 miles—but
from the enunciation of these numbers what positive idea
do we derive?</p>

<p>If we ascend an ordinary mountain and look around us
from its summit, we behold a landscape stretching, say 40
miles, in every direction; forming a circle 250 miles in circumference;
and including an area of 5000 square miles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
The extent of such a prospect, on account of the <i>successiveness</i>
with which its portions necessarily present themselves
to view, can be only very feebly and very partially
appreciated:—yet the entire panorama would comprehend
no more than one 40,000th part of the mere <i>surface</i> of
our globe. Were this panorama, then, to be succeeded,
after the lapse of an hour, by another of equal extent; this
again by a third, after the lapse of another hour; this again
by a fourth after lapse of another hour—and so on, until
the scenery of the whole Earth were exhausted; and were
we to be engaged in examining these various panoramas
for twelve hours of every day; we should nevertheless, be
9 years and 48 days in completing the general survey.</p>

<p>But if the mere surface of the Earth eludes the grasp
of the imagination, what are we to think of its cubical contents?
It embraces a mass of matter equal in weight to
at least 2 sextillions, 200 quintillions of tons. Let us suppose
it in a state of quiescence; and now let us endeavor
to conceive a mechanical force sufficient to set it in motion!
Not the strength of all the myriads of beings whom
we may conclude to inhabit the planetary worlds of our
system—not the combined physical strength of <i>all</i> these
beings—even admitting all to be more powerful than man—would
avail to stir the ponderous mass <i>a single inch</i> from
its position.</p>

<p>What are we to understand, then, of the force, which
under similar circumstances, would be required to move
the <i>largest</i> of our planets, Jupiter? This is 86,000 miles
in diameter, and would include within its periphery more
than a thousand orbs of the magnitude of our own. Yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
this stupendous body is actually flying around the Sun at
the rate of 29,000 miles an hour—that is to say, with a
velocity 40 times greater than that of a cannon-ball! The
thought of such a phænomenon cannot well be said to
<i>startle</i> the mind:—it palsies and appals it. Not unfrequently
we task our imagination in picturing the capacities
of an angel. Let us fancy such a being at a distance of
some hundred miles from Jupiter—a close eye-witness of
this planet as it speeds on its annual revolution. Now
<i>can</i> we, I demand, fashion for ourselves any conception so
distinct of this ideal being’s spiritual exaltation, as <i>that</i> involved
in the supposition that, even by this immeasurable
mass of matter, whirled immediately before his eyes, with
a velocity so unutterable, he—an angel—angelic though
he be—is not at once struck into nothingness and overwhelmed?</p>

<p>At this point, however, it seems proper to suggest that,
in fact, we have been speaking of comparative trifles. Our
Sun, the central and controlling orb of the system to which
Jupiter belongs, is not only greater than Jupiter, but greater
by far than all the planets of the system taken together.
This fact is an essential condition, indeed, of the stability
of the system itself. The diameter of Jupiter has been
mentioned:—it is 86,000 miles:—that of the Sun is 882,000
miles. An inhabitant of the latter, travelling 90 miles a
day, would be more than 80 years in going round a great
circle of its circumference. It occupies a cubical space of
681 quadrillions, 472 trillions of miles. The Moon, as has
been stated, revolves about the Earth at a distance of
237,000 miles—in an orbit, consequently, of nearly a million<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and a half. Now, were the Sun placed upon the
Earth, centre over centre, the body of the former would
extend, in every direction, not only to the line of the
Moon’s orbit, but beyond it, a distance of 200,000 miles.</p>

<p>And here, once again, let me suggest that, in fact, we
have <i>still</i> been speaking of comparative trifles. The distance
of the planet Neptune from the Sun has been stated:—it
is 28 hundred millions of miles; the circumference of
its orbit, therefore, is about 17 billions. Let this be borne
in mind while we glance at some one of the brightest stars.
Between this and the star of <i>our</i> system, (the Sun,) there
is a gulf of space, to convey any idea of which we should
need the tongue of an archangel. From <i>our</i> system, then,
and from <i>our</i> Sun, or star, the star at which we suppose
ourselves glancing is a thing altogether apart:—still, for
the moment, let us imagine it placed upon our Sun, centre
over centre, as we just now imagined this Sun itself placed
upon the Earth. Let us now conceive the particular star
we have in mind, extending, in every direction, beyond the
orbit of Mercury—of Venus—of the Earth:—still <i>on</i>, beyond
the orbit of Mars—of Jupiter—of Uranus—until,
finally, we fancy it filling the circle—17 <i>billions of miles
in circumference</i>—which is described by the revolution of
Leverrier’s planet. When we have conceived all this, we
shall have entertained no extravagant conception. There
is the very best reason for believing that many of the stars
are even far larger than the one we have imagined. I
mean to say that we have the very best <i>empirical</i> basis for
such belief:—and, in looking back at the original, atomic
arrangements for <i>diversity</i>, which have been assumed as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
part of the Divine plan in the constitution of the Universe,
we shall be enabled easily to understand, and to credit, the
existence of even far vaster disproportions in stellar size
than any to which I have hitherto alluded. The largest
orbs, of course, we must expect to find rolling through the
widest vacancies of Space.</p>

<p>I remarked, just now, that to convey an idea of the interval
between our Sun and any one of the other stars, we
should require the eloquence of an archangel. In so saying,
I should not be accused of exaggeration; for, in simple
truth, these are topics on which it is scarcely possible to
exaggerate. But let us bring the matter more distinctly
before the eye of the mind.</p>

<p>In the first place, we may get a general, <i>relative</i> conception
of the interval referred to, by comparing it with
the inter-planetary spaces. If, for example, we suppose the
Earth, which is, in reality, 95 millions of miles from the
Sun, to be only <i>one foot</i> from that luminary; then Neptune
would be 40 feet distant; <i>and the star Alpha Lyræ, at the
very least</i>, 159.</p>

<p>Now I presume that, in the termination of my last sentence,
few of my readers have noticed anything especially
objectionable—particularly wrong. I said that the distance
of the Earth from the Sun being taken at <i>one foot</i>, the distance
of Neptune would be 40 feet, and that of Alpha Lyræ, 159.
The proportion between one foot and 159 has appeared,
perhaps, to convey a sufficiently definite impression of the
proportion between the two intervals—that of the Earth
from the Sun and that of Alpha Lyræ from the same luminary.
But my account of the matter should, in reality,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
have run thus:—The distance of the Earth from the Sun
being taken at one foot, the distance of Neptune would be
40 feet, and that of Alpha Lyræ, 159——<i>miles</i>:—that is to
say, I had assigned to Alpha Lyræ, in my first statement
of the case, only the 5280<i>th</i> <i>part</i> of that distance which is
the <i>least distance possible</i> at which it can actually lie.</p>

<p>To proceed:—However distant a mere <i>planet</i> is, yet
when we look at it through a telescope, we see it under a
certain form—of a certain appreciable size. Now I have
already hinted at the probable bulk of many of the stars;
nevertheless, when we view any one of them, even through
the most powerful telescope, it is found to present us with
<i>no form</i>, and consequently with <i>no magnitude</i> whatever.
We see it as a point and nothing more.</p>

<p>Again;—Let us suppose ourselves walking, at night, on
a highway. In a field on one side of the road, is a line of
tall objects, say trees, the figures of which are distinctly
defined against the background of the sky. This line of
objects extends at right angles to the road, and from the
road to the horizon. Now, as we proceed along the road,
we see these objects changing their positions, respectively,
in relation to a certain fixed point in that portion of the
firmament which forms the background of the view. Let
us suppose this fixed point—sufficiently fixed for our purpose—to
be the rising moon. We become aware, at once,
that while the tree nearest us so far alters its position in
respect to the moon, as to seem flying behind us, the tree
in the extreme distance has scarcely changed at all its relative
position with the satellite. We then go on to perceive
that the farther the objects are from us, the less they alter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
their positions; and the converse. Then we begin, unwittingly,
to estimate the distances of individual trees by the
degrees in which they evince the relative alteration. Finally,
we come to understand how it might be possible to
ascertain the actual distance of any given tree in the line,
by using the amount of relative alteration as a basis in a
simple geometrical problem. Now this relative alteration
is what we call “parallax;” and by parallax we calculate
the distances of the heavenly bodies. Applying the principle
to the trees in question, we should, of course, be very
much at a loss to comprehend the distance of <i>that</i> tree,
which, however far we proceeded along the road, should
evince <i>no</i> parallax at all. This, in the case described, is a
thing impossible; but impossible only because all distances
on our Earth are trivial indeed:—in comparison with the
vast cosmical quantities, we may speak of them as absolutely
nothing.</p>

<p>Now, let us suppose the star Alpha Lyræ directly overhead;
and let us imagine that, instead of standing on the
Earth, we stand at one end of a straight road stretching
through Space to a distance equalling the diameter of the
Earth’s orbit—that is to say, to a distance of 190 <i>millions
of miles</i>. Having observed, by means of the most delicate
micrometrical instruments, the exact position of the star,
let us now pass along this inconceivable road, until we
reach its other extremity. Now, once again, let us look at
the star. It is <i>precisely</i> where we left it. Our instruments,
however delicate, assure us that its relative position is absolutely—is
identically the same as at the commencement
of our unutterable journey. <i>No</i> parallax—none whatever—has
been found.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact is, that, in regard to the distance of the fixed
stars—of any one of the myriads of suns glistening on the
farther side of that awful chasm which separates our system
from its brothers in the cluster to which it belongs—astronomical
science, until very lately, could speak only
with a negative certainty. Assuming the brightest as the
nearest, we could say, even of <i>them</i>, only that there is a
certain incomprehensible distance on the <i>hither</i> side of
which they cannot be:—how far they are beyond it we had
in no case been able to ascertain. We perceived, for example,
that Alpha Lyræ cannot be nearer to us than 19 trillions,
200 billions of miles; but, for all we knew, and
indeed for all we now know, it may be distant from us the
square, or the cube, or any other power of the number
mentioned. By dint, however, of wonderfully minute and
cautious observations, continued, with novel instruments,
for many laborious years, <i>Bessel</i>, not long ago deceased,
has lately succeeded in determining the distance of six or
seven stars; among others, that of the star numbered 61
in the constellation of the Swan. The distance in this latter
instance ascertained, is 670,000 times that of the Sun;
which last it will be remembered, is 95 millions of miles.
The star 61 Cygni, then, is nearly 64 trillions of miles from
us—or more than three times the distance assigned, <i>as the
least possible</i>, for Alpha Lyræ.</p>

<p>In attempting to appreciate this interval by the aid of
any considerations of <i>velocity</i>, as we did in endeavoring to
estimate the distance of the moon, we must leave out of
sight, altogether, such nothings as the speed of a cannon-ball,
or of sound. Light, however, according to the latest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
calculations of Struve, proceeds at the rate of 167,000 miles
in a second. Thought itself cannot pass through this interval
more speedily—if, indeed, thought can traverse it at
all. Yet, in coming from 61 Cygni to us, even at this inconceivable
rate, light occupies more than <i>ten years</i>; and,
consequently, were the star this moment blotted out from
the Universe, still, <i>for ten years</i>, would it continue to sparkle
on, undimmed in its paradoxical glory.</p>

<p>Keeping now in mind whatever feeble conception we
may have attained of the interval between our Sun and 61
Cygni, let us remember that this interval, however unutterably
vast, we are permitted to consider as but the <i>average</i>
interval among the countless host of stars composing that
cluster, or “nebula,” to which our system, as well as that
of 61 Cygni, belongs. I have, in fact, stated the case with
great moderation:—we have excellent reason for believing
61 Cygni to be one of the <i>nearest</i> stars, and thus for concluding,
at least for the present, that its distance from us is
<i>less</i> than the average distance between star and star in the
magnificent cluster of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>And here, once again and finally, it seems proper to
suggest that even as yet we have been speaking of trifles.
Ceasing to wonder at the space between star and star in
our own or in any particular cluster, let us rather turn our
thoughts to the intervals between cluster and cluster, in the
all comprehensive cluster of the Universe.</p>

<p>I have already said that light proceeds at the rate of
167,000 miles in a second—that is, about 10 millions of
miles in a minute, or about 600 millions of miles in an
hour:—yet so far removed from us are some of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
“nebulæ” that even light, speeding with this velocity,
could not and does not reach us, from those mysterious
regions, in less than 3 <i>millions of years</i>. This calculation,
moreover, is made by the elder Herschell, and in reference
merely to those comparatively proximate clusters within
the scope of his own telescope. There <i>are</i> “nebulæ,”
however, which, through the magical tube of Lord Rosse,
are this instant whispering in our ears the secrets of <i>a
million of ages</i> by-gone. In a word, the events which we
behold now—at this moment—in those worlds—are the
identical events which interested their inhabitants <i>ten hundred
thousand centuries ago</i>. In intervals—in distances
such as this suggestion forces upon the <i>soul</i>—rather than
upon the mind—we find, at length, a fitting climax to all
hitherto frivolous considerations of <i>quantity</i>.</p>

<p>Our fancies thus occupied with the cosmical distances, let
us take the opportunity of referring to the difficulty which
we have so often experienced, while pursuing <i>the beaten path</i>
of astronomical reflection, <i>in accounting</i> for the immeasurable
voids alluded to—in comprehending why chasms so
totally unoccupied and therefore apparently so needless, have
been made to intervene between star and star—between cluster
and cluster—in understanding, to be brief, a sufficient reason
for the Titanic scale, in respect of mere <i>Space</i>, on which
the Universe is seen to be constructed. A rational cause
for the phænomenon, I maintain that Astronomy has palpably
failed to assign:—but the considerations through which,
in this Essay, we have proceeded step by step, enable us
clearly and immediately to perceive that <i>Space and Duration
are one</i>. That the Universe might <i>endure</i> throughout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
an æra at all commensurate with the grandeur of its component
material portions and with the high majesty of its
spiritual purposes, it was necessary that the original atomic
diffusion be made to so inconceivable an extent as to be
only not infinite. It was required, in a word, that the stars
should be gathered into visibility from invisible nebulosity—proceed
from nebulosity to consolidation—and so grow
grey in giving birth and death to unspeakably numerous
and complex variations of vitalic development:—it was
required that the stars should do all this—should have time
thoroughly to accomplish all these Divine purposes—<i>during
the period</i> in which all things were effecting their return
into Unity with a velocity accumulating in the inverse
proportion of the squares of the distances at which lay the
inevitable End.</p>

<p>Throughout all this we have no difficulty in understanding
the absolute accuracy of the Divine <i>adaptation</i>. The
density of the stars, respectively, proceeds, of course, as
their condensation diminishes; condensation and heterogeneity
keep pace with each other; through the latter,
which is the index of the former, we estimate the vitalic
and spiritual development. Thus, in the density of the
globes, we have the measure in which their purposes are
fulfilled. <i>As</i> density proceeds—<i>as</i> the divine intentions
<i>are</i> accomplished—<i>as</i> less and still less remains <i>to be</i> accomplished—so—in
the same ratio—should we expect to
find an acceleration of <i>the End</i>:—and thus the philosophical
mind will easily comprehend that the Divine designs in
constituting the stars, advance <i>mathematically</i> to their fulfilment:—and
more; it will readily give the advance a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
mathematical expression; it will decide that this advance
is inversely proportional with the squares of the distances
of all created things from the starting-point and goal of
their creation.</p>

<p>Not only is this Divine adaptation, however, mathematically
accurate, but there is that about it which stamps
it <i>as divine</i>, in distinction from that which is merely the
work of human constructiveness. I allude to the complete
<i>mutuality</i> of adaptation. For example; in human constructions
a particular cause has a particular effect; a particular
intention brings to pass a particular object; but this
is all; we see no reciprocity. The effect does not re-act
upon the cause; the intention does not change relations
with the object. In Divine constructions the object is
either design or object as we choose to regard it—and
we may take at any time a cause for an effect, or the converse—so
that we can never absolutely decide which is
which.</p>

<p>To give an instance:—In polar climates the human
frame, to maintain its animal heat, requires, for combustion
in the capillary system, an abundant supply of highly
azotized food, such as train-oil. But again:—in polar climates
nearly the sole food afforded man is the oil of abundant
seals and whales. Now, whether is oil at hand because
imperatively demanded, or the only thing demanded because
the only thing to be obtained? It is impossible to decide.
There is an absolute <i>reciprocity of adaptation</i>.</p>

<p>The pleasure which we derive from any display of
human ingenuity is in the ratio of <i>the approach</i> to this
species of reciprocity. In the construction of <i>plot</i>, for example,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
in fictitious literature, we should aim at so arranging
the incidents that we shall not be able to determine, of
any one of them, whether it depends from any one other
or upholds it. In this sense, of course, <i>perfection</i> of <i>plot</i>
is really, or practically, unattainable—but only because it is
a finite intelligence that constructs. The plots of God are
perfect. The Universe is a plot of God.</p>

<p>And now we have reached a point at which the intellect
is forced, again, to struggle against its propensity for
analogical inference—against its monomaniac grasping at
the infinite. Moons have been seen <i>revolving</i> about
planets; planets about stars; and the poetical instinct of
humanity—its instinct of the symmetrical, if the symmetry
be but a symmetry of surface:—this <i>instinct</i>, which the
Soul, not only of Man but of all created beings, took up,
in the beginning, from the <i>geometrical</i> basis of the Universal
irradiation—impels us to the fancy of an endless extension
of this system of <i>cycles</i>. Closing our eyes equally to
<i>de</i>duction and <i>in</i>duction, we insist upon imagining a <i>revolution</i>
of all the orbs of the Galaxy about some gigantic
globe which we take to be the central pivot of the whole.
Each cluster in the great cluster of clusters is imagined, of
course, to be similarly supplied and constructed; while,
that the “analogy” may be wanting at no point, we go on
to conceive these clusters themselves, again, as <i>revolving</i>
about some still more august sphere;—this latter, still again,
<i>with</i> its encircling clusters, as but one of a yet more magnificent
series of agglomerations, <i>gyrating</i> about yet
another orb central <i>to them</i>—some orb still more unspeakably
sublime—some orb, let us rather say, of infinite sublimity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
endlessly multiplied by the infinitely sublime. Such
are the conditions, continued in perpetuity, which the voice
of what some people term “analogy” calls upon the Fancy
to depict and the Reason to contemplate, if possible, without
becoming dissatisfied with the picture. Such, <i>in general</i>,
are the interminable gyrations beyond gyration which we
have been instructed by Philosophy to comprehend and to
account for, at least in the best manner we can. Now
and then, however, a philosopher proper—one whose
phrenzy takes a very determinate turn—whose genius, to
speak more reverentially, has a strongly-pronounced washerwomanish
bias, doing every thing up by the dozen—enables
us to see <i>precisely</i> that point out of sight, at which the revolutionary
processes in question do, and of right ought to,
come to an end.</p>

<p>It is hardly worth while, perhaps, even to sneer at the
reveries of Fourrier:—but much has been said, latterly, of
the hypothesis of Mädler—that there exists, in the centre
of the Galaxy, a stupendous globe about which all the systems
of the cluster revolve. The <i>period</i> of our own, indeed,
has been stated—117 millions of years.</p>

<p>That our Sun has a motion in space, independently of
its rotation, and revolution about the system’s centre of
gravity, has long been suspected. This motion, granting it
to exist, would be manifested perspectively. The stars in
that firmamental region which we were leaving behind us,
would, in a very long series of years, become crowded;
those in the opposite quarter, scattered. Now, by means of
astronomical History, we ascertain, cloudily, that some
such phænomena have occurred. On this ground it has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
been declared that our system is moving to a point in the
heavens diametrically opposite the star Zeta Herculis:—but
this inference is, perhaps, the maximum to which we have
any logical right. Mädler, however, has gone so far as to
designate a particular star, Alcyone in the Pleiades, as being
at or about the very spot around which a general <i>revolution</i>
is performed.</p>

<p>Now, since by “analogy” we are led, in the first instance,
to these dreams, it is no more than proper that we
should abide by analogy, at least in some measure, during
their development; and that analogy which suggests the
revolution, suggests at the same time a central orb about
which it should be performed:—so far the astronomer was
consistent. This central orb, however, should, dynamically,
be greater than all the orbs, taken together, which surround
it. Of these there are about 100 millions. “Why, then,”
it was of course demanded, “do we not <i>see</i> this vast central
sun—<i>at least equal</i> in mass to 100 millions of such
suns as ours—why do we not <i>see</i> it—<i>we</i>, especially, who
occupy the mid region of the cluster—the very locality
<i>near</i> which, at all events, must be situated this incomparable
star?” The reply was ready—“It must be non-luminous,
as are our planets.” Here, then, to suit a purpose,
analogy is suddenly let fall. “Not so,” it may be
said—“we know that non-luminous suns actually exist.”
It is true that we have reason at least for supposing so; but
we have certainly no reason whatever for supposing that
the non-luminous suns in question are encircled by <i>luminous</i>
suns, while these again are surrounded by non-luminous
planets:—and it is precisely all this with which Mädler is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
called upon to find any thing analogous in the heavens—for
it is precisely all this which he imagines in the case of
the Galaxy. Admitting the thing to be so, we cannot help
here picturing to ourselves how sad a puzzle the <i>why it is so</i>
must prove to all <i>à priori</i> philosophers.</p>

<p>But granting, in the very teeth of analogy and of every
thing else, the non-luminosity of the vast central orb, we
may still inquire how this orb, so enormous, could fail of
being rendered visible by the flood of light thrown upon it
from the 100 millions of glorious suns glaring in all directions
about it. Upon the urging of this question, the idea
of an actually solid central sun appears, in some measure,
to have been abandoned; and speculation proceeded to
assert that the systems of the cluster perform their revolutions
merely about an immaterial centre of gravity common
to all. Here again then, to suit a purpose, analogy is let
fall. The planets of our system revolve, it is true, about a
common centre of gravity; but they do this in connexion
with, and in consequence of, a material sun whose mass
more than counterbalances the rest of the system.</p>

<p>The mathematical circle is a curve composed of an infinity
of straight lines. But this idea of the circle—an idea
which, in view of all ordinary geometry, is merely the mathematical,
as contradistinguished from the practical, idea—is,
in sober fact, the <i>practical</i> conception which alone we
have any right to entertain in regard to the majestic circle
with which we have to deal, at least in fancy, when we
suppose our system revolving about a point in the centre
of the Galaxy. Let the most vigorous of human imaginations
attempt but to take a single step towards the comprehension<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of a sweep so ineffable! It would scarcely be
paradoxical to say that a flash of lightning itself, travelling
<i>forever</i> upon the circumference of this unutterable circle,
would still, <i>forever</i>, be travelling in a straight line. That
the path of our Sun in such an orbit would, to any human
perception, deviate in the slightest degree from a straight
line, even in a million of years, is a proposition not to be
entertained:—yet we are required to believe that a curvature
has become apparent during the brief period of our
astronomical history—during a mere point—during the utter
nothingness of two or three thousand years.</p>

<p>It may be said that Mädler <i>has</i> really ascertained a
curvature in the direction of our system’s now well-established
progress through Space. Admitting, if necessary,
this fact to be in reality such, I maintain that nothing is
thereby shown except the reality of this fact—the fact of a
curvature. For its <i>thorough</i> determination, ages will be
required; and, when determined, it will be found indicative
of some binary or other multiple relation between our Sun
and some one or more of the proximate stars. I hazard
nothing however, in predicting, that, after the lapse of many
centuries, all efforts at determining the path of our Sun
through Space, will be abandoned as fruitless. This is
easily conceivable when we look at the infinity of perturbation
it must experience, from its perpetually-shifting relations
with other orbs, in the common approach of all to the
nucleus of the Galaxy.</p>

<p>But in examining other “nebulæ” than that of the
Milky Way—in surveying, generally, the clusters which
overspread the heavens—do we or do we not find confirmation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of Mädler’s hypothesis? We do <i>not</i>. The forms
of the clusters are exceedingly diverse when casually
viewed; but on close inspection, through powerful telescopes,
we recognize the sphere, very distinctly, as at least
the proximate form of all:—their constitution, in general,
being at variance with the idea of revolution about a common
centre.</p>

<p>“It is difficult,” says Sir John Herschell, “to form any
conception of the dynamical state of such systems. On one
hand, without a rotary motion and a centrifugal force, it is
hardly possible not to regard them as in a state of <i>progressive
collapse</i>. On the other, granting such a motion and
such a force, we find it no less difficult to reconcile their
forms with the rotation of the whole system [meaning cluster]
around any single axis, without which internal collision
would appear to be inevitable.”</p>

<p>Some remarks lately made about the “nebulæ” by
Dr. Nichol, in taking quite a different view of the cosmical
conditions from any taken in this Discourse—have a very
peculiar applicability to the point now at issue. He says:</p>

<p>“When our greatest telescopes are brought to bear
upon them, we find that those which were thought to be
irregular, are not so; they approach nearer to a globe.
Here is one that looked oval; but Lord Rosse’s telescope
brought it into a circle.... Now there occurs a very
remarkable circumstance in reference to these comparatively
sweeping circular masses of nebulæ. We find they
are not entirely circular, but the reverse; and that all
around them, on every side, there are volumes of stars,
<i>stretching out apparently as if they were rushing towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
a great central mass in consequence of the action of some
great power</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Were I to describe, in my own words, what must
necessarily be the existing condition of each nebula on the
hypothesis that all matter is, as I suggest, now returning to
its original Unity, I should simply be going over, nearly
verbatim, the language here employed by Dr. Nichol, without
the faintest suspicion of that stupendous truth which is
the key to these nebular phænomena.</p>

<p>And here let me fortify my position still farther, by the
voice of a greater than Mädler—of one, moreover, to whom
all the data of Mädler have long been familiar things, carefully
and thoroughly considered. Referring to the elaborate
calculations of Argelander—the very researches which form
Mädler’s basis—<i>Humboldt</i>, whose generalizing powers have
never, perhaps been equalled, has the following observation:</p>

<p>“When we regard the real, proper, or non-perspective
motions of the stars, we find <i>many groups of them moving
in opposite directions</i>; and the data as yet in hand render
it not necessary, at least, to conceive that the systems composing
the Milky Way, or the clusters, generally, composing
the Universe, are revolving about any particular centre
unknown, whether luminous or non-luminous. It is but
Man’s longing for a fundamental First Cause, that impels
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>both his intellect and his fancy to the adoption of such an
hypothesis.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The phænomenon here alluded to—that of “many
groups moving in opposite directions”—is quite inexplicable
by Mädler’s idea; but arises, as a necessary consequence,
from that which forms the basis of this Discourse.
While the <i>merely general direction</i> of each atom—of each
moon, planet, star, or cluster—would, on my hypothesis, be,
of course, absolutely rectilinear; while the <i>general</i> path of
all bodies would be a right line leading to the centre of all;
it is clear, nevertheless, that this general rectilinearity would
be compounded of what, with scarcely any exaggeration,
we may term an infinity of particular curves—an infinity
of local deviations from rectilinearity—the result of continuous
differences of relative position among the multitudinous
masses, as each proceeded on its own proper journey
to the End.</p>

<p>I quoted, just now, from Sir John Herschell, the following
words, used in reference to the clusters:—“On one
hand, without a rotary motion and a centrifugal force, it is
hardly possible not to regard them as in a state of <i>progressive
collapse</i>.” The fact is, that, in surveying the “nebulæ”
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>with a telescope of high power, we shall find it quite
impossible, having once conceived this idea of “collapse,”
not to gather, at all points, corroboration of the idea. A
nucleus is always apparent, in the direction of which the
stars seem to be precipitating themselves; nor can these
nuclei be mistaken for merely perspective phænomena:—the
clusters are <i>really</i> denser near the centre—sparser in
the regions more remote from it. In a word, we see every
thing as we <i>should</i> see it were a collapse taking place;
but, in general, it may be said of these clusters, that we can
fairly entertain, while looking at them, the idea of <i>orbitual
movement about a centre</i>, only by admitting the <i>possible</i>
existence, in the distant domains of space, of dynamical
laws with which <i>we</i> are unacquainted.</p>

<p>On the part of Herschell, however, there is evidently
<i>a reluctance</i> to regard the nebulæ as in “a state of progressive
collapse.” But if facts—if even appearances justify
the supposition of their being in this state, <i>why</i>, it may
well be demanded, is he disinclined to admit it? Simply
on account of a prejudice;—merely because the supposition
is at war with a preconceived and utterly baseless notion—that
of the endlessness—that of the eternal stability of
the Universe.</p>

<p>If the propositions of this Discourse are tenable, the
“state of progressive collapse” is <i>precisely</i> that state in
which alone we are warranted in considering All Things;
and, with due humility, let me here confess that, for my
part, I am at a loss to conceive how any <i>other</i> understanding
of the existing condition of affairs, could ever have made
its way into the human brain. “The tendency to collapse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>”
and “the attraction of gravitation” are convertible phrases.
In using either, we speak of the rëaction of the First Act.
Never was necessity less obvious than that of supposing
Matter imbued with an ineradicable <i>quality</i> forming part
of its material nature—a quality, or instinct, <i>forever</i> inseparable
from it, and by dint of which inalienable principle
every atom is <i>perpetually</i> impelled to seek its fellow-atom.
Never was necessity less obvious than that of entertaining
this unphilosophical idea. Going boldly behind the vulgar
thought, we have to conceive, metaphysically, that the gravitating
principle appertains to Matter <i>temporarily</i>—only
while diffused—only while existing as Many instead of as
One—appertains to it by virtue of its state of irradiation
alone—appertains, in a word, altogether to its <i>condition</i>,
and not in the slightest degree to <i>itself</i>. In this view, when
the irradiation shall have returned into its source—when
the rëaction shall be completed—the gravitating principle
will no longer exist. And, in fact, astronomers, without
at any time reaching the idea here suggested, seem to have
been approximating it, in the assertion that “if there were
but one body in the Universe, it would be impossible to
understand how the principle, Gravity, could obtain:”—that
is to say, from a consideration of Matter as they find
it, they reach a conclusion at which I deductively arrive.
That so pregnant a suggestion as the one just quoted should
have been permitted to remain so long unfruitful, is, nevertheless,
a mystery which I find it difficult to fathom.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, in no little degree, however, our propensity
for the continuous—for the analogical—in the present
case more particularly for the symmetrical—which has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
been leading us astray. And, in fact, the sense of the symmetrical
is an instinct which may be depended upon with
an almost blindfold reliance. It is the poetical essence of
the Universe—<i>of the Universe</i> which, in the supremeness of
its symmetry, is but the most sublime of poems. Now
symmetry and consistency are convertible terms:—thus
Poetry and Truth are one. A thing is consistent in the
ratio of its truth—true in the ratio of its consistency. <i>A
perfect consistency, I repeat, can be nothing but an absolute
truth.</i> We may take it for granted, then, that Man cannot
long or widely err, if he suffer himself to be guided by his
poetical, which I have maintained to be his truthful, in
being his symmetrical, instinct. He must have a care,
however, lest, in pursuing too heedlessly the superficial symmetry
of forms and motions, he leave out of sight the really
essential symmetry of the principles which determine and
control them.</p>

<p>That the stellar bodies would finally be merged in one—that,
at last, all would be drawn into the substance of <i>one
stupendous central orb already existing</i>—is an idea which,
for some time past, seems, vaguely and indeterminately, to
have held possession of the fancy of mankind. It is an idea,
in fact, which belongs to the class of the <i>excessively obvious</i>.
It springs, instantly, from a superficial observation of the
cyclic and seemingly <i>gyrating</i>, or <i>vorticial</i> movements
of those individual portions of the Universe which come
most immediately and most closely under our observation.
There is not, perhaps, a human being, of ordinary education
and of average reflective capacity, to whom, at some
period, the fancy in question has not occurred, as if spontaneously,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
or intuitively, and wearing all the character
of a very profound and very original conception. This
conception, however, so commonly entertained, has never,
within my knowledge, arisen out of any abstract considerations.
Being, on the contrary, always suggested, as I say,
by the vorticial movements about centres, a reason for it,
also,—a <i>cause</i> for the ingathering of all the orbs into one,
<i>imagined to be already existing</i>, was naturally sought in
the same direction—among these cyclic movements themselves.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that, on announcement of the gradual
and perfectly regular decrease observed in the orbit of
Enck’s comet, at every successive revolution about our
Sun, astronomers were nearly unanimous in the opinion
that the cause in question was found—that a principle was
discovered sufficient to account, physically, for that final,
universal agglomeration which, I repeat, the analogical,
symmetrical or poetical instinct of Man had predetermined
to understand as something more than a simple hypothesis.</p>

<p>This cause—this sufficient reason for the final ingathering—was
declared to exist in an exceedingly rare but still
material medium pervading space; which medium, by retarding,
in some degree, the progress of the comet, perpetually
weakened its tangential force; thus giving a predominance
to the centripetal; which, of course, drew the comet
nearer and nearer at each revolution, and would eventually
precipitate it upon the Sun.</p>

<p>All this was strictly logical—admitting the medium or
ether; but this ether was assumed, most illogically, on the
ground that no <i>other</i> mode than the one spoken of could be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
discovered, of accounting for the observed decrease in the
orbit of the comet:—as if from the fact that we could <i>discover</i>
no other mode of accounting for it, it followed, in
any respect, that no other mode of accounting for it existed.
It is clear that innumerable causes might operate, in combination,
to diminish the orbit, without even a possibility of
our ever becoming acquainted with one of them. In the
meantime, it has never been fairly shown, perhaps, why the
retardation occasioned by the skirts of the Sun’s atmosphere,
through which the comet passes at perihelion, is not enough
to account for the phænomenon. That Enck’s comet will
be absorbed into the Sun, is probable; that all the comets of
the system will be absorbed, is more than merely possible;
but, in such case, the principle of absorption must be referred
to eccentricity of orbit—to the close approximation
to the Sun, of the comets at their perihelia; and is a principle
not affecting, in any degree, the ponderous <i>spheres</i>,
which are to be regarded as the true material constituents
of the Universe.—Touching comets, in general, let me here
suggest, in passing, that we cannot be far wrong in looking
upon them as the <i>lightning-flashes of the cosmical Heaven</i>.</p>

<p>The idea of a retarding ether and, through it, of a final
agglomeration of all things, seemed at one time, however,
to be confirmed by the observation of a positive decrease
in the orbit of the solid moon. By reference to eclipses
recorded 2500 years ago, it was found that the velocity of
the satellite’s revolution <i>then</i> was considerably less than it
is <i>now</i>; that on the hypothesis that its motions in its orbit
is uniformly in accordance with Kepler’s law, and was accurately
determined <i>then</i>—2500 years ago—it is now in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
advance of the position it <i>should</i> occupy, by nearly 9000
miles. The increase of velocity proved, of course, a diminution
of orbit; and astronomers were fast yielding to a belief
in an ether, as the sole mode of accounting for the phænomenon,
when Lagrange came to the rescue. He showed
that, owing to the configurations of the spheroids, the shorter
axes of their ellipses are subject to variation in length;
the longer axes being permanent; and that this variation
is continuous and vibratory—so that every orbit is in a
state of transition, either from circle to ellipse, or from ellipse
to circle. In the case of the moon, where the shorter
axis is <i>de</i>creasing, the orbit is passing from circle to ellipse
and, consequently, is <i>de</i>creasing too; but, after a long series
of ages, the ultimate eccentricity will be attained; then the
shorter axis will proceed to <i>in</i>crease, until the orbit becomes
a circle; when the process of shortening will again
take place;—and so on forever. In the case of the Earth,
the orbit is passing from ellipse to circle. The facts thus
demonstrated do away, of course, with all necessity for supposing
an ether, and with all apprehension of the system’s
instability—on the ether’s account.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that I have myself assumed what
we may term <i>an ether</i>. I have spoken of a subtle <i>influence</i>
which we know to be ever in attendance upon matter,
although becoming manifest only through matter’s heterogeneity.
To this <i>influence</i>—without daring to touch it at
all in any effort at explaining its awful <i>nature</i>—I have referred
the various phænomena of electricity, heat, light, magnetism;
and more—of vitality, consciousness, and thought—in
a word, of spirituality. It will be seen, at once, then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
that the ether thus conceived is radically distinct from the
ether of the astronomers; inasmuch as theirs is <i>matter</i> and
mine <i>not</i>.</p>

<p>With the idea of a material ether, seems, thus, to have
departed altogether the thought of that universal agglomeration
so long predetermined by the poetical fancy of
mankind:—an agglomeration in which a sound Philosophy
might have been warranted in putting faith, at least to a
certain extent, if for no other reason than that by this
poetical fancy it <i>had</i> been so predetermined. But so far
as Astronomy—so far as mere Physics have yet spoken, the
cycles of the Universe are perpetual—the Universe has no
conceivable end. Had an end been demonstrated, however,
from so purely collateral a cause as an ether, Man’s
instinct of the Divine <i>capacity to adapt</i>, would have rebelled
against the demonstration. We should have been forced
to regard the Universe with some such sense of dissatisfaction
as we experience in contemplating an unnecessarily
complex work of human art. Creation would have affected
us as an imperfect <i>plot</i> in a romance, where the <i>dénoûment</i>
is awkwardly brought about by interposed incidents
external and foreign to the main subject; instead of springing
out of the bosom of the thesis—out of the heart of the
ruling idea—instead of arising as a result of the primary
proposition—as inseparable and inevitable part and parcel
of the fundamental conception of the book.</p>

<p>What I mean by the symmetry of mere surface will
now be more clearly understood. It is simply by the blandishment
of this symmetry that we have been beguiled into
the general idea of which Mädler’s hypothesis is but a part—the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
idea of the vorticial indrawing of the orbs. Dismissing
this nakedly physical conception, the symmetry of principle
sees the end of all things metaphysically involved in
the thought of a beginning; seeks and finds in this origin
of all things the <i>rudiment</i> of this end; and perceives the
impiety of supposing this end likely to be brought about
less simply—less directly—less obviously—less artistically—than
through <i>the rëaction of the originating Act</i>.</p>

<p>Recurring, then, to a previous suggestion, let us understand
the systems—let us understand each star, with its
attendant planets—as but a Titanic atom existing in space
with precisely the same inclination for Unity which characterized,
in the beginning, the actual atoms after their irradiation
throughout the Universal sphere. As these original
atoms rushed towards each other in generally straight lines,
so let us conceive as at least generally rectilinear, the paths
of the system-atoms towards their respective centres of
aggregation:—and in this direct drawing together of the
systems into clusters, with a similar and simultaneous
drawing together of the clusters themselves while undergoing
consolidation, we have at length attained the great
<i>Now</i>—the awful Present—the Existing Condition of the
Universe.</p>

<p>Of the still more awful Future a not irrational analogy
may guide us in framing an hypothesis. The equilibrium
between the centripetal and centrifugal forces of each system,
being necessarily destroyed upon attainment of a certain
proximity to the nucleus of the cluster to which it
belongs, there must occur, at once, a chaotic or seemingly
chaotic precipitation, of the moons upon the planets, of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
planets upon the suns, and of the suns upon the nuclei;
and the general result of this precipitation must be the
gathering of the myriad now-existing stars of the firmament
into an almost infinitely less number of almost infinitely
superior spheres. In being immeasurably fewer,
the worlds of that day will be immeasurably greater than
our own. Then, indeed, amid unfathomable abysses, will
be glaring unimaginable suns. But all this will be merely
a climacic magnificence foreboding the great End. Of
this End the new genesis described, can be but a very partial
postponement. While undergoing consolidation, the
clusters themselves, with a speed prodigiously accumulative,
have been rushing towards their own general centre—and
now, with a thousand-fold electric velocity, commensurate
only with their material grandeur and with the spiritual
passion of their appetite for oneness, the majestic
remnants of the tribe of Stars flash, at length, into a common
embrace. The inevitable catastrophe is at hand.</p>

<p>But this catastrophe—what is it? We have seen accomplished
the ingathering of the orbs. Henceforward,
are we not to understand <i>one material globe of globes</i> as
constituting and comprehending the Universe? Such a
fancy would be altogether at war with every assumption
and consideration of this Discourse.</p>

<p>I have already alluded to that absolute <i>reciprocity of
adaptation</i> which is the idiosyncrasy of the divine Art—stamping
it divine. Up to this point of our reflections, we
have been regarding the electrical influence as a something
by dint of whose repulsion alone Matter is enabled to exist
in that state of diffusion demanded for the fulfilment of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
its purposes:—so far, in a word, we have been considering
the influence in question as ordained for Matter’s sake—to
subserve the objects of matter. With a perfectly legitimate
reciprocity, we are now permitted to look at Matter,
as created <i>solely for the sake of this influence</i>—solely to
serve the objects of this spiritual Ether. Through the aid—by
the means—through the agency of Matter, and by
dint of its heterogeneity—is this Ether manifested—is
<i>Spirit individualized</i>. It is merely in the development of
this Ether, through heterogeneity, that particular masses of
Matter become animate—sensitive—and in the ratio of
their heterogeneity;—some reaching a degree of sensitiveness
involving what we call <i>Thought</i> and thus attaining
Conscious Intelligence.</p>

<p>In this view, we are enabled to perceive Matter as a
Means—not as an End. Its purposes are thus seen to have
been comprehended in its diffusion; and with the return
into Unity these purposes cease. The absolutely consolidated
globe of globes would be <i>objectless</i>:—therefore not
for a moment could it continue to exist. Matter, created
for an end, would unquestionably, on fulfilment of that end,
be Matter no longer. Let us endeavor to understand that
it would disappear, and that God would remain all in all.</p>

<p>That every work of Divine conception must cöexist
and cöexpire with its particular design, seems to me especially
obvious; and I make no doubt that, on perceiving
the final globe of globes to be <i>objectless</i>, the majority of my
readers will be satisfied with my “<i>therefore</i> it cannot continue
to exist.” Nevertheless, as the startling thought of its
instantaneous disappearance is one which the most powerful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
intellect cannot be expected readily to entertain on
grounds so decidedly abstract, let us endeavor to look at
the idea from some other and more ordinary point of view:—let
us see how thoroughly and beautifully it is corroborated
in an <i>à posteriori</i> consideration of Matter as we actually
find it.</p>

<p>I have before said that “Attraction and Repulsion being
undeniably the sole properties by which Matter is manifested
to Mind, we are justified in assuming that Matter
<i>exists</i> only as Attraction and Repulsion—in other words
that Attraction and Repulsion <i>are</i> Matter; there being no
conceivable case in which we may not employ the term
Matter and the terms ‘Attraction’ and ‘Repulsion’ taken
together, as equivalent, and therefore convertible, expressions
in Logic.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Now the very definition of Attraction implies particularity—the
existence of parts, particles, or atoms; for we
define it as the tendency of “each atom &amp;c. to every other
atom” &amp;c. according to a certain law. Of course where
there are <i>no</i> parts—where there is absolute Unity—where
the tendency to oneness is satisfied—there can be no Attraction:—this
has been fully shown, and all Philosophy
admits it. When, on fulfilment of its purposes, then, Matter
shall have returned into its original condition of <i>One</i>—a
condition which presupposes the expulsion of the separative
ether, whose province and whose capacity are limited
to keeping the atoms apart until that great day when, this
ether being no longer needed, the overwhelming pressure
of the finally collective Attraction shall at length just sufficiently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>predominate<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and expel it:—when, I say, Matter,
finally, expelling the Ether, shall have returned into absolute
Unity,—it will then (to speak paradoxically for the
moment) be Matter without Attraction and without Repulsion—in
other words, Matter without Matter—in other
words, again, <i>Matter no more</i>. In sinking into Unity, it
will sink at once into that Nothingness which, to all Finite
Perception, Unity must be—into that Material Nihility
from which alone we can conceive it to have been evoked—to
have been <i>created</i> by the Volition of God.</p>

<p>I repeat then—Let us endeavor to comprehend that the
final globe of globes will instantaneously disappear, and that
God will remain all in all.</p>

<p>But are we here to pause? Not so. On the Universal
agglomeration and dissolution, we can readily conceive that
a new and perhaps totally different series of conditions may
ensue—another creation and irradiation, returning into
itself—another action and rëaction of the Divine Will.
Guiding our imaginations by that omniprevalent law of
laws, the law of periodicity, are we not, indeed, more than
justified in entertaining a belief—let us say, rather, in indulging
a hope—that the processes we have here ventured
to contemplate will be renewed forever, and forever, and
forever; a novel Universe swelling into existence, and then
subsiding into nothingness, at every throb of the Heart
Divine?</p>

<p>And now—this Heart Divine—what is it? <i>It is our
own.</i></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>Let not the merely seeming irreverence of this idea
frighten our souls from that cool exercise of consciousness—from
that deep tranquillity of self-inspection—through
which alone we can hope to attain the presence of this,
the most sublime of truths, and look it leisurely in the
face.</p>

<p>The <i>phænomena</i> on which our conclusions must at this
point depend, are merely spiritual shadows, but not the less
thoroughly substantial.</p>

<p>We walk about, amid the destinies of our world-existence,
encompassed by dim but ever present <i>Memories</i> of a
Destiny more vast—very distant in the by-gone time, and
infinitely awful.</p>

<p>We live out a Youth peculiarly haunted by such dreams;
yet never mistaking them for dreams. As Memories we
<i>know</i> them. <i>During our Youth</i> the distinction is too clear
to deceive us even for a moment.</p>

<p>So long as this Youth endures, the feeling <i>that we exist</i>,
is the most natural of all feelings. We understand it <i>thoroughly</i>.
That there was a period at which we did <i>not</i>
exist—or, that it might so have happened that we never
had existed at all—are the considerations, indeed, which
<i>during this youth</i>, we find difficulty in understanding. Why
we should <i>not</i> exist, is, <i>up to the epoch of our Manhood</i>, of
all queries the most unanswerable. Existence—self-existence—existence
from all Time and to all Eternity—seems,
up to the epoch of Manhood, a normal and unquestionable
condition:—<i>seems, because it is</i>.</p>

<p>But now comes the period at which a conventional
World-Reason awakens us from the truth of our dream.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Doubt, Surprise and Incomprehensibility arrive at the same
moment. They say:—“You live and the time was when
you lived not. You have been created. An Intelligence
exists greater than your own; and it is only through this
Intelligence you live at all.” These things we struggle to
comprehend and cannot:—<i>cannot</i>, because these things,
being untrue, are thus, of necessity, incomprehensible.</p>

<p>No thinking being lives who, at some luminous point of
his life of thought, has not felt himself lost amid the surges
of futile efforts at understanding, or believing, that anything
exists <i>greater than his own soul</i>. The utter impossibility
of any one’s soul feeling itself inferior to another; the intense,
overwhelming dissatisfaction and rebellion at the
thought;—these, with the omniprevalent aspirations at perfection,
are but the spiritual, coincident with the material,
struggles towards the original Unity—are, to my mind at
least, a species of proof far surpassing what Man terms demonstration,
that no one soul <i>is</i> inferior to another—that
nothing is, or can be, superior to any one soul—that each
soul is, in part, its own God—its own Creator:—in a word,
that God—the material <i>and</i> spiritual God—<i>now</i> exists solely
in the diffused Matter and Spirit of the Universe; and that
the regathering of this diffused Matter and Spirit will be
but the re-constitution of the <i>purely</i> Spiritual and Individual
God.</p>

<p>In this view, and in this view alone, we comprehend
the riddles of Divine Injustice—of Inexorable Fate. In this
view alone the existence of Evil becomes intelligible; but
in this view it becomes more—it becomes endurable. Our
souls no longer rebel at a <i>Sorrow</i> which we ourselves have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
imposed upon ourselves, in furtherance of our own purposes—with
a view—if even with a futile view—to the
extension of our own <i>Joy</i>.</p>

<p>I have spoken of <i>Memories</i> that haunt us during our
youth. They sometimes pursue us even in our Manhood:—assume
gradually less and less indefinite shapes:—now
and then speak to us with low voices, saying:</p>

<p>“There was an epoch in the Night of Time, when a
still-existent Being existed—one of an absolutely infinite
number of similar Beings that people the absolutely infinite
domains of the absolutely infinite space.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> It was not and
is not in the power of this Being—any more than it is in
your own—to extend, by actual increase, the joy of his
Existence; but just as it <i>is</i> in your power to expand or to
concentrate your pleasures (the absolute amount of happiness
remaining always the same) so did and does a similar
capability appertain to this Divine Being, who thus passes
his Eternity in perpetual variation of Concentrated Self
and almost Infinite Self-Diffusion. What you call The
Universe is but his present expansive existence. He now
feels his life through an infinity of imperfect pleasures—the
partial and pain-intertangled pleasures of those inconceivably
numerous things which you designate as his creatures,
but which are really but infinite individualizations of Himself.
All these creatures—<i>all</i>—those which you term animate,
as well as those to whom you deny life for no better
reason than that you do not behold it in operation—<i>all</i>
these creatures have, in a greater or less degree, a capacity</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>
<p>for pleasure and for pain:—<i>but the general sum of their sensations
is precisely that amount of Happiness which appertains
by right to the Divine Being when concentrated within
Himself</i>. These creatures are all, too, more or less conscious
Intelligences; conscious, first, of a proper identity;
conscious, secondly and by faint indeterminate glimpses, of
an identity with the Divine Being of whom we speak—of
an identity with God. Of the two classes of consciousness,
fancy that the former will grow weaker, the latter stronger,
during the long succession of ages which must elapse before
these myriads of individual Intelligences become blended—when
the bright stars become blended—into One. Think
that the sense of individual identity will be gradually merged
in the general consciousness—that Man, for example, ceasing
imperceptibly to feel himself Man, will at length attain that
awfully triumphant epoch when he shall recognize his existence
as that of Jehovah. In the meantime bear in mind
that all is Life—Life—Life within Life—the less within the
greater, and all within the <i>Spirit Divine</i>.”</p>

country or in Europe, the publisher confidently believes that the undertaking will meet
with a prompt and cordial response. To say this, is perhaps superfluous and impertinent;

the works of Washington Irving; while the English language itself comprises no purer

<p class="center">I.</p>

<p class="ads2">A Grammar of the Anglo-Saxon Language. By Louis F. Klipstein, AA.LL.M. and
PH.D., of the University of Giessen.</p>

<p class="ads">⁂ This work recommends itself particularly to the attention of every American
student who “glories in his Anglo-Saxon descent” or Teutonic lineage, as well as of all
who desire an acquaintance with a language which lies as the foundation of the English,
and throws a light upon its elements and structure, derivable from no other source. Of
the importance and interesting nature of the study there can be no doubt, and we agree
with those who think that the time is coming when it will be considered “utterly disgraceful
for any well-bred Englishman or American” to have neglected it. With regard to the
merits of Dr. Klipstein’s Grammar, we will only say, that it has been already adopted as
a text-book in some of the leading Institutions of our country.</p>

<p class="ads" style="text-align: center">[The following are also in press.]</p>

<p class="center">II.</p>

<p class="ads2">Analecta Anglo-Saxonica, with an Introductory Ethnographical Essay, Copious Notes, Critical
and Explanatory, and a Glossary in which are shown the Indo-Germanic and other
Affinities of the Language. <i>By the same.</i></p>

<p class="ads">In this work appear the fruits of considerable research, and, we may add, learning.
The Ethnology of Europe is succinctly, but clearly illustrated, the Anglo-Saxon language
completely analysed, revealing the utmost harmony of combination from its elements, its
forms and roots compared with those in kindred dialects and cognate tongues, its position
in the Teutonic family and Indo-Germanic range established, and the genuine relation of the
English to its great parent properly set forth. To those who are fond of the comparative
study of language, the Glossary will prove an invaluable aid, apart from its particular
object.</p>

<p class="center">III.</p>

<p class="ads2">Natale Sancti Gregorii Papæ.—Ælfric’s Homily on the Birth-day of St. Gregory, and Collateral
Extracts from King Alfred’s version of Bede’s Ecclesiastical History and the
Saxon Chronicle, with a full rendering into English, Notes Critical and Explanatory,
and an Index of Words. <i>By the same.</i></p>

<p class="center">IV.</p>

<p class="ads2">Extracts from the Anglo-Saxon-Gospels, a Portion of the Anglo-Saxon Paraphrase of the
Book of Psalms, and other Selections of a Sacred Order in the same Language, with a
Translation into English, and Notes Critical and Explanatory. <i>By the same.</i></p>

<p class="ads">These two works are prepared in such a way as in themselves, with the aid of the
Grammar, to afford every facility to the Anglo-Saxon Student. Ælfric’s Homily is remarkable
for beauty of composition, and interesting as setting forth Augustine’s Mission to the
“Land of the Angles.”</p>

<p class="center">V.</p>

<p class="ads2">Tha Halgan Godspel on Englisc—the Anglo-Saxon Version of the Holy Gospels. Edited
by Benjamin Thorpe, F.S.A. <i>Reprinted by the same. Now ready.</i></p>

<p class="ads">This, the earliest “English” version of the Four Gospels, will be found interesting to
the antiquarian and theologian, as well as serviceable to the student in his investigations
of the language. The Text, besides the usual but unbroken division, appears, with the
Rubrics, as read in the early Anglican Church.</p>

<small>By L.&nbsp;F. Klipstein, AA.LL.M. and Ph.D. One Vol. Imperial 8vo.
75 cents paper; $1 00 cloth.</small></p>

<p class="ads">This work, which is intended equally for the simultaneous and the separate study of the
languages that it sets forth, and which is adapted as well for the native of Germany,
France, Italy, Spain, or Portugal, as for him to whom English is vernacular, in the acquirement
of any one of the other tongues besides his own, will be found an acceptable manual
not only to the tyro, but to the more advanced scholar. The reading portion of the matter
is interesting, and the text in every case remarkably correct, while the Elementary Phrases,
forms of Cards, Letters, Bills of Exchange, Promissory Notes, Receipts, &amp;c., in the six
languages, constitute what has long been a desideratum from the American press. For
the comparative study of the <i>Romanic</i> tongues the work affords unusual facilities.</p>

“Order gave each thing view.”</p>

<p class="ads">One large Vol. comprising 2560 closely printed columns,—(indicating <i>every word and
passage</i> in Shakspeare’s Works). Price $6. Cloth.</p>

<p class="ads">“The result of sixteen years of untiring labor. The different editions of Shakspeare
have been carefully collated by the compiler, and every possible means taken to insure
the correctness of the work. As it now stands, a person can find a particular passage in
Shakspeare by simply remembering one word of it, and is also referred to the act and scene
of the play in which it occurs. As a mere dictionary of Shakspearian language and
phrases, it is of great value; but it is also a dictionary of his thoughts and imaginations.
It altogether supersedes the volumes of Twiss and Ayscough, and should be on every
student’s shelves”—<i>Boston Courier.</i></p>

<p class="ads">⁂ This extraordinary work is printed in London and the price there <i>at present</i> is
£2. 5s. 0d. or about $12. A large part of the edition having been purchased for this market,
it is furnished here for the very low price of $6, bound in cloth.</p>

Author of “Political Ethics,” &amp;c., has just sailed for his native country—Germany—with
the view of aiding in the great cause of Constitutional and Rational Freedom. This
little volume proves that he has well studied that subject during his long residence in this
his adopted country—and his able and valuable opinions on American Society and Progress,
carry with them a peculiar interest at this time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5a" id="Page_5a">[5]</a></span></p>
